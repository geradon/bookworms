A MAGIC OF BOOKWORMS

There are various contradictory versions of the story of the painter Marco di Salvieri. Marco di Salvieri was said to have had four wives—on this point the four Bookworms agree... But from this founding consensus, a veritable tree of discordant facts unfolded. For months now, at the very heart of the book you are reading (and that’s its soul), the life of the polygamous artist has been bitterly debated, divided between four divergent readings, four _flavours_ of the same biographies—four ways of filling in the gaps in history.

When the Bookworm that I am first develops the idea that Di Salvieri, indeed united to four damsels, did not consummate any of his marriages, Bookworm Jacqueline laughs—the candles flicker; her enormous spongy grimoire topples over the desk, she compasses it almost standing up—her index finger hovers over a decomposing page and then taps a bulging nota bene, reading « _the painter was certainly not very tactile_, _but he did honour his four wives, as a man in love would! »—_But when she goes on to tell us about her own chimera, namely that Marcel de Salve was in fact French, and not Italian as I have been claiming since the first meetings, with a sonorous sigh Bookworm Claudine throws her arms in the air, deplores the dishonesty of the various translators on whom the three of us have decidedly stumbled, they who would have taken advantage of their free pen to move the artist's place of residence (probably with the aim of seducing the national readership?)—to Parma, to Catalonia or to the suburbs of Paris—whereas he lived—it is written in a thousand places in her readings—in Salzburg; and that he was Prussian—and that his name was not Marco, Marcel or who knows what—but Markus Von Salviertt! What's more, this Markus, still according to the exhausting "historical" research of Bookworm Claudine—not only honoured his four wives, but by dint of screwing the lot he had turned them into real wenches in his time!—after which we are subjected, by the left and in a learned tone, to a fourth version of the man’s life, who, according to the tedious readings of Bookworm Beatrice, was in reality a woman, a painter it is true, but who walked the Port Vell in the north-east of Spain—and she was called Marcia da Salverio!

And off we went again; our volumes lying flat under our lamps, I whispered my latest discoveries, and they let me talk: Marco di Salvieri (who, I maintained, walked the fields of Emilia-Romagna with an easel on his back), lived on the outskirts of the Duchy of Parma, where he owned a piece of land of which I showed a title deed transcript. It was in this region that he had a discussion one day (or one drunken night, depending on the version) with a friend. His friend, whose name has not been preserved in history, but whom we shall call "Emilio", had told him that he was such a poor painter and that he should definitely do something else with his life. Marco di Salvieri did not deny it; yes, indeed, he was a poor artist, but he pointed out that his easel, his brush and his oily palette always ended up in front of naked and lustful young women, didn’t they? What was the point of being a prodigious artist when a mischievous incompetent could see the same result? This equipment, from easel to stool, allowed him to "strike a pose" as much as his models lying on the wild grass. All he had to do was to modulate an air that was at once inspired, inhabited and tortured—so that the painting could always have its back to them: as long as it was not revealed, Marco would potentially be the greatest artist in Emilia Romagna. But was this a way for him to find a wife, Emilio had asked. Marco di Salvieri had answered "four!", and his friend, who did not see any marriage actually happening, had wondered about the painter's mental health. Di Salvieri passed him the bottle of Grappa and told him that it would not be long before he would see; soon he, Marco di Salvieri, would have four women in his bed, and he would marry all four of them! And a Bourbon-Parma, and an Este, and a Farnese, and a Gonzaga!

Emilio understood the joke and after another sip of wine he asked his friend if he "didn't want anything else with his four wives?"

"What more could I want? To be _good-looking_?" The painter’s tirade was almost a reproach. It was that Marco di Salvieri, who was therefore not talented at all, was not a very handsome man either. _She was indeed a rather common woman,_ confirmed Bookworm Beatrice (always in the learned tone she gave to her interruptions), _to the point where she was early condemned to wanking off drunkards at the exit of the hostels of Port Vell in order to defer her anonymity_. Bookworm Jacqueline, behind her counter, had coughed briefly without taking her eyes off her book. She bent her elbow towards the "silence" sign.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the main room with silent steps._

_Bookworm Beatrice resumes her reading under the lamp. She turns a thick, burnished page._

Marcia da Salverio was a redhead, said Bookworm Beatrice, and this Italian story in no way obscures her life as an immoral paintress from Catalonia—on the contrary; Catalan details, by the Mediterranean, are confirmed. For if this other line of fiction situates her home in Girona, it suggests (at least for two of us contemporary Bookworms, and even if ridiculously so) a certain South-Latin proximity. A Mediterranean plausibility.

_Marcia's anonymity was evasive_, that was a wobbly phrase Bookworm Beatrice had uttered to describe Marco's, Marcia's, Marcel's or Markus' incognito; an adjective that must have been something like _relative anonymity_, but I enjoyed watching Beatrice's eyes peel back her sixth form synonyms.

_Bookworm_ _Beatrice leaves the main hall._

_There is silence._

When silence fell in such a way, the atmosphere in the library changed. Then, I would casually contemplate the volume of gas that Bookworm Jacqueline occupied at the counter. In this cubic metre of sulphur, I thought, perspired Bookworm Jacqueline and her book. She, with her eyes lowered to an indecipherable page, I imagined, her face lit from below, the shadow of her chin on her nose, that of her cheekbones in her eyes, she would remind me of unconscious Pandora opening her box. In this volume of gas, this statue with a large bun and inverted features was perhaps reading a passage that would upset all three of us. I had imagined her unfolding the leather cover on an illumination. Perhaps she was staring at me from underneath too, assessing the relevance of showing me her discovery, this inconceivable turn of events in Marco's life that the rest knew nothing about. My delirium persisted: now she was boiling, reeking of the carbon that emanated from her body; in this volume, her own oxygen was macerating, snaking within itself, a little beige as the perfume of genitals confined for too long, dirty blonde hair waving like seaweed in a spicy soup. I know now that she is staring at me.

_Bookworm Claudine enters the reading room._

_Bookworm Beatrice enters the reading room._

I think of anonymity, I think of the volume of stale air; of our four volumes of stale air, ours, our own, with our own sulphur, our own gas, growing since the distant days of the baths, effluvia that is carried like an endless spicy veil through the reading room, from lamps to shelves, from shelves to lamps. To anonymity. To Marco di Salvieri. To the way he sows us through the pages. To invoke our lies.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the reading room._

_Bookworm Beatrice is lost in contemplation of the vehicles at ground level._ A yellow Caterpillar truck behind a white Ford. I dream that it is raining, I decide that it is raining; that the cobblestones of the streets are black with rain. The voice of Bookworm Claudine reaches us from the vestibule. It's a melody she whispers, maybe it's a song, maybe it's a poem in several tones.

..._The Library and its Bookworms_

_A penumbra marked out by glimmers_

_Where different types of sulphur_

_Can be cooked over time..._

(_Bookworm Beatrice no longer observes the vehicles, she leaves the reading room, and then the singing in the south room no longer reaches me_)_._

Claudine was the last one to lock herself in here. We had watched her for a long time before agreeing that she was indeed a Bookworm. Beatrice and I had surrounded her, almost cornered her. _Do you know what a Bookworm is? It's a little wriggling animal that gnaws on old books. We both think, and so does Madame Jacqueline, that you are a Bookworm, because you wriggle when you read the life of Marco di Salvieri. Of Marcia da Salverio, Beatrice would tell you._ Madame Jacqueline lowers her glasses and whispers _of Marcel de Salve._ Claudine's eyes were black, very large, and she was reading us, stroking the hard, dusty cover of a grey-green volume_._ She seemed to be in a state of shock. We had just told her that her personal and secret lover, Markus Von Salviertt, had other suitors. Her mouth chewed slowly in silence, as if to capture the flavour of the strange names we were calling Markus. _She feels naked, her eyes are gigantic, we have caught her in the act, she will show us her hands to prove that she did not have them between her thighs while reading the adventures of Markus Von Salviertt._

_Claudine had left the reading room._

_Beatrice had left the reading room._

I had watched their waistlines, from behind, as they left for the eastern section, and then I stood alone for a while (with Bookworm Jacqueline at her counter), a strange image in my mind; Bookworm Claudine, I had told myself, her extreme thinness was her asset, not her face. I could have wrapped my tongue around her waspish waist. She, a skinny child, could not have wrapped her arms around mine. To me especially, Claudine had a dream waist. Perhaps she was Marco's Maria Antonia Dorotea, Marcel's Manon Roland—or Maria Lòpes de Luna, that young woman with the famously small waistline that Marcia's biographies apparently inform. I remembered that, according to the same Spanish stories, I was Margarita de Prades, the most generous of all. I unfolded the grey-green cover that Claudine had left behind and looked at the text she had been reading. German. I wondered how one could masturbate over German, but the stains proved me one could.

Bookworms wriggle over rare books, and the four of us were all slithering flesh. This had earned us dates where Jean, Thierry or Ludovic, all of them scruffy, would leap to their feet and swallow air, their fists on a slimy penis. It would take us a long time to realise that we were devoted to Marco. We had all been problematic pukers in our younger days—even Bookworm Beatrice, who preferred girls, had flooded the short chestnut clods of her life, so that in the milieu she even had a "reputation", which, it must be said (she was telling us this in the vestibule, while Madame Jacqueline breathed _silence_ in an exhausted manner, from her counter in the reading room) that this "reputation" had become a more famous asset than Bookworm Claudine's waist.

_Bookworm Claudine enters the reading room. She can be heard sniffing ostentatiously._

_Madame Jacqueline looks up for a moment at Bookworm Claudine._

_Bookworm Beatrice watches the vehicles below. She wishes it would rain. For the shine and the black. But Bookworm Claudine cries, that will do. Let her cry over the yellow truck and the white Ford. She stares at their metallic frame, imagines sudden peaks on the yellow and white aluminium, and the grey of the cobblestones that jerkily turns black._

Madame Jacqueline once waxed lyrical about a book on the back row of a shelf in the North Reading Room. She said 'the north room' rather than 'reading room 2', because the library is in the shape of a cross, a cross of five rooms, from the vestibule to room 2, passing through room 1, the central one, where we have our habits, and she her counter. A north room, a south room, an east room, a west room and a central room. It wasn't complicated, she said, but we still had to think about east and west. The east was the powder room, and the west we didn't really talk about, it didn't have a name, or rather it had a thousand’s, which we kept to ourselves.

The book in question was in French, Madame said, and contained the story of the youth of Marcel de Salve and his four wives. We weren't really listening, because it was that story all over again, and because we were perhaps still wondering whether the West was left or right; but to keep us interested in her monologue no doubt (and that was clever), when she rattled off the four women's names, she pointed in turn at each and every one of us. So I was Claire Lacombe, Bookworm Beatrice was Christine de Pizan, Bookworm Claudine was Manon Roland and she, Madame Jacqueline, was Madame de Maintenon—and then we stared at her.

Her story did not actually take place (she said, at least) in Catalonia, Emilia-Romagna or Salzburg, but in the suburbs of Paris.

Marcel de Salve, in this book (inaccessible, of course—I'm just saying), lived over three centuries in the vicinity of Paris. I think for a moment about Claire Lacombe, of what I might have looked like at the time of the Revolution, and I finally remember well that I had a cardboard false arse indeed, at some point in my lives. Bookworm Beatrice secretly examines her nails, because Madame Jacqueline describes the dirtiness of Christine de Pizan's fingers. Bookworm Claudine seems to be waiting for the moment when Madame will say that "Marcel" has shagged us, but that never happens. Like Markus, like Marco, like Marcia, the cardboard arses of Marcel's wives have never snapped under his attacks. Is this true?

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the reading room._

Two hours later, the four of us were in the east room, the powder room, and we were happily powdering ourselves. Bookworm Claudine turned her head to the side, and so did I, because the sulphur and gas emanating from the brunettes' cunt had reached our noses. Bookworm Beatrice had no doubt heard what Madame was saying about Christine de Pizan, the details of what was going on inside her false arse, and Bookworm Beatrice had begun to scratch herself, her nails would go black that's for sure, it was disgusting of course, but it gave us another opportunity to appreciate the well-built, well-proportioned body of Christine de Pizan—this injustice ran through the generations and the fictions, I had already thought so when she was Vittoria Farnese, and we had started, Bookworm Claudine and I, to powder ourselves furiously, and I could see that we were both thinking of the same thing, that is to say: how could Marco stop himself from buttfucking her—Bookworm Claudine's little pout as she sent the powder to her armpits showed that we were both thinking about the same hole.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the powder room._

_Madame Jacqueline continues to smell like an egg in her wicket, but nothing is said._

Marcel de Salve had been shagging us. I thought he hadn't, but he had. I don't know if Madame made this up to keep our attention or if it was because this version of Marco di Salvieri was a Frenchman, or better still, because we were Frenchwomen and it was well known. The story was that Marcel de Salve had a good friend, whose name remains a mystery, and that one day the painter predicted that his paintings would bring him four wives. To which the friend, whom we shall call "Émile", had slapped his thigh "Ah!" But Marcel knew what he was doing; he was ugly, but he was clever, and he had piled up four wives in his Boulogne home. Bookworm Beatrice, in a falsely detached manner, wanted to know how precisely he shagged us, well, how he shagged Christine de Pizan for example, but Madame Jacqueline looked evasive, the back of her hand wandering to the inaccessible rows of shelves, those at the very top, out of reach of our outstretched arms, plunged into the absolute darkness. Maybe one day we'll be able to tell—who knows?—if the worm-eaten shelves end up collapsing, vomiting onto the library floor those tomes we think we can see up there. Bookworm Beatrice seemed to be interested in that part of Marcia da Salverio's biography where it is stated that the paintress tried her hand at one and only one man, having been content, as the Bookworm liked to point out a little too often, to jerk off the drunkards here and there. "We agree, she said, that wanking off drunkards is not true love, or else I've known true love a very long time ago, and I didn’t enjoy it that much." At least, I told myself, she, Beatrice, had known true love.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the reading room for the north room._

Madame Jacqueline becomes a confidante. We are both almost face to face. "Madame de Maintenon was Marcel's first." Old cunt. Old blunderbuss. She sailed down the rows that Bookworm Claudine was trying to reach in the north room.

_We had won the southern section._

We chewed our meat in silence. I gnawed the brown shin-like pieces, remembering the books about Marco di Salvieri’s youth. I stared at the mirror where an enormous Elisabeth of Parma reflected back her bovine eye. To a question from Bookworm Beatrice to Bookworm Claudine (which I heard but did not listen to), the latter replied "Ja, Ja, sicher," and Madame and Bookworm Beatrice gave an amused snort, and Bookworm Claudine did not understand at once "Was gibts?" then she put her two hands over her mouth and giggled to herself, delighted.

After dinner our reading resumed. We were all lost in the silence of the central room, the sporadic sliding of parchment chapters punctuated the afternoon, until the evening poured. Every day we tried to glean new information about Marco, about Marcia, about Markus or about Marcel, and it never occurred to me that the information I was gleaning always concerned Marco di Salvieri; never Marcia, Markus or Marcel. And that it was the same for the others—each of us seemed to only come across the elaborations of our own version. Sometimes a sound of cracking wood, three faces would rise, and we would observe a back and an arm stretched towards a high shelf. We could hardly reach the sixth level; only Madame Jacqueline, that giraffe of a woman, managed to reach the seventh level on the tips of her toes. Of course, we could each see an eighth level, hidden in almost total darkness. It was impossible to see any higher. Of course, that was precisely where the possibility existed. All possibilities. That I was the favourite of Marco's four wives. That he had a taste for curvaceous women. That he made me two children. That in the evenings he would beat my arse like a psychotic butcher.

I have left off the description of the West Wing, the famous West Wing, the pinnacle of this story, the threshold we never dare cross, "and in there will be the last volume of each of Marco di Salvieri's versions, in which everything will become clear to the Bookworms and the reader."

_Bookworm Beatrice gains the West Wing._

No; the West Wing is not a place to deflower after overcoming our irrational fears, closing this quadruple swoon story with a nimble fall. It isn’t.

The West Wing is the place we shit in. The place where we shit, piss and masturbate. We go there one at a time, when possible; it's a last coquetry we allow ourselves as respectable wives.

_Bookworm Beatrice leaves the West Wing._

By dint of entering this cesspool, we manage to feel who precisely preceded us there, even if we eat the same thing. Or what she did there. And often how much.

But here too is our mausoleum; four small mounds to the glory of our husband. This is how I learned what the yellow and red flag of Catalonia looked like. And where I learned to appreciate Bookworm Claudine's photo montages. Among the candles, underneath the Prussian flag, are famous people in black and white glued on a background reminiscent of Tyrol. That's Claudine's idea of _him_. Markus is tall, dark and sarcastic, and reminds me of a star from the last century. Maybe he's a young Justin Bieber, but I don't ask. I couldn't bear it if she asked me, if _I_ were making schoolgirl-style photo montages. And then, in these effluvia, when you have your hand between your thighs, you sometimes want to let yourself think that photography existed during the Black Plague. You don't know anything for sure, you just feel yourself leaving, and then it's Marco di Salvieri, his fingers on his dark glasses, his jacket on his shoulder, displaying a smile that knows exactly what you're doing with the other hand.

There are also a number of out-of-order appliances piled up here. Old radios, as far as I know. A round black tray with a gigantic metal flower stuck in it by a thin needle. An orange plastic device with twisted wiring and a white disc with holes and numbers in it. There's a bell inside and the top part comes off. Old Madame Jacqueline is the only one who could really tell what these things were for. And then there is this condemned floor, probably the attic of the library. A rudimentary staircase leads to a small trapdoor through which my pond would probably not fit. Sometimes I think about the rain falling directly under the roof of this attic. I let myself dream about it. By the time I reach the bottom of the small staircase, my boots are soaking in four different flavours of shit—four different ways of turning Frolic into a stringy paste.

Marcia the redhead, from her Catalan surname Da Salverio, had accumulated four marriages, thwarting the prognosis of her best friend (whom we shall call Emilia), to whom she had early on mentioned her plans. She had told her that she was the "Paintress" and that this singularity at the time had earned her the confidence of a certain type of women, embarrassed by the male gaze of their father's or uncle's painters. Emilia that day was washing Marcia's red hair and, standing behind her, she gauged her friend's expression from above. Cautiously, Emilia asked, "Who are you thinking of marrying, my dear?" and she heard Marcia's smile click. "Sibylle de Fortià, first of all, for her plastic beauty; Margarita de Prades, for her morphological generosity; Maria López de Luna, because she prefers men. And my last prey is none other than Joseph, because he too prefers men." Emilia had swallowed air: Joseph Bergler, it was a gamble for him to marry a lady. However, Marcia did marry all four, and lived for many years painting naked bodies and drowning boats on the Port Vell.

We powdered ourselves in a cathedral-like silence. Madame Jacqueline would go round her yellow mare's teeth with her pommel, pass over her shoulders, dabbing mint into the shiny gutter between her breasts. The rest of us were there once a month because Madame was there; as if the meeting had to take place contractually. Bookworm Beatrice stood and anointed her entire body with a film of soap, the beautiful body that Bookworm Claudine and I always looked at in fascinated silence. I waited for Bookworm Claudine to take off her trousers, to admire her waistline, which my brain couldn't seem to accept, as if it was thirsting for this inconceivable model image. We might have smelled of mint in the powder room, but we were only guessing, for we could smell nothing. The cathedral-like silence continued. Then, with the tip of a lung, Bookworm Claudine asked a question. We all turned to Madame Jacqueline, for it seemed implicit that the question should be put to her. Madame Jacqueline continued to powder herself, and this went on for a few minutes. Then she summed up the question: "Does magic exist?", and Bookworm Claudine said "_Real_ magic". I think that if Bookworm Claudine had asked the two of us, and not Madame, we would have gone on about mercury, sulphur and salt, and that we had been immersed in this alchemy for months. But Madame Jacqueline was staring at Bookworm Claudine in the mirror without a smile, and one sensed that the answer would have to do with books. "Real magic, of course it exists. You're in it; we're in it. Don't you think so?"

_Madame Jacqueline will tell us a story._

"I will tell you a story. When I was a little girl, I read _The Adventures of Daria Devushka_ by Debor Konstantinov. It was a seven-volume saga, but, importantly, while I was reading it, like all other young readers, I didn't know that there would be more than one volume, didn't know that it was actually a long saga in the making. When I finished that book, I burst into incredulous tears, because at the last page, in place of the word "END", there was a sentence informing a sequel to the Adventures of Daria Devushka. A sequel that would be released the following year. Then I was plunged into a strange state, a second state of euphoria and love, of impatience and infinite possibilities. Of hope. Of faith. It was this phase, my first contact with real magic, my dear Bookworms. The discovery of a sequel, or the promise of one, when you think you're done with the greatest story in the world. More generally: the awareness of a future of which we know nothing and in which everything is possible—even by definition the impossible. For Debor Konstantinov's elaboration of true magic did not stop there. The author was lying on his deathbed when he scratched out the last sentences of his seventh volume years later. And before he drew his last breath, knowing full well that he would not live through the night, he wrote a very, very last sentence in place of the word ‘END’, in that seventh volume. His widow discovered it, stained with blood, shortly after the funeral, when she packed up her late husband's last papers and filed the scattered sheets of his last manuscript. This sentence was ‘The continuation of The Adventures of Daria Devushka will be discovered in volume 8 to be published at an undetermined date.’ That's the real magic." Madame looked at us one after the other in the mirror, and we all just stood there, we stayed like that. When she put on her glasses, she added, "And we, here in the library, don't live anything else; we wait for the next volume. We know it is there, among the thousands of accessible books, or the hundred or so inaccessible books in the eighth level. Or ninth? Books in the dark. The continuation of the adventures of Marco, Markus, Marcia and Marcel. It's all here, and let me tell you something: if _The Adventures of Daria Devushka_ were seven volumes long, our husband’s number of volumes is far too many for us to have enough time in our lives to read it all. That's just it—real magic exists, and all four of us are in the grip of the Library's magic."

Tonight I saw Bookworm Beatrice standing on a small table in front of one of the shelves in the northern section. Her body was pressed against the spine of the accessible books and she was reaching for the seventh shelf. In her hand I could see a wooden spoon, which she seemed to be scraping one more level up.

Once a week we have a kind of meeting. We pull the desks out of the central room and sit in a circle on the floor on the Persian carpet. A mound of candles is formed in the centre of this circle, and sometimes we put a particular volume on it, sometimes just candles. And we meditate, our eyes on the three faces around us. That night, in the middle of the circle, the Prussian mausoleum of Justin Bieber was placed. It was a brass totem pole, which presented us with the black and white photo of Tyrol, which we rotated on a moving tray. The Franco-Italian-Prussian-Catalan painter was posted at the foot of the mountains, and we didn't know when the photograph might have been taken, but Marco looked debonair and rather unaffected by the apparent cold of the snowy scene. He was in a light shirt, casual, his jacket thrown over his shoulder, and he wore dark glasses over a smile that told us "I know, I know, I understand, don't faint!" We each shivered with cold as the tray turned, then Marco finally faced me. The contemplative silence continued, and the tray had gone around the slow circle maybe thirty times. It was now in front of Bookworm Claudine, and on the other side of the candles Claudine's eyes glistened like a lake on fire. Pure, raw love; I imagined her huge heart, her gaping cunt, and it wasn't hard to imagine at that moment.

_Marcel de Salve did not really live in Paris, but Madame Jacqueline could imagine, and rightly so, that we would not really know the difference between the City of Light and Boulogne._ For it was in an inn in Boulogne that Marcel and his friend, whom we shall call Émile, were remaking the world. Marcel painted gourds (according to Émile) and fornicated often, and almost systematically. When morning came and Marcel turned the gourd from his hay, Émile was surprised to find a blank canvas on the easel. "You haven't painted anything, Marcel? Why then did that gourd jump around your cock?" Marcel, who didn't bother to get dressed (or to wash himself, Émile noticed), stood at the window and thoughtfully filled his pipe: "It's the pose that does it, my good Émile." And Émile wondered how the pose of the gourds could generate in them a desire to fornicate with a painter who did not paint her at all. "Not the gourd pose, Émile; my own pose. The one I mime, the one of the inspired artist at his easel. They don't want to know how I don't paint them; besides, I don't show them until it's finished; and since I don't finish or start, in that I'm very fair!" Émile sat still, thinking a little. "You have only one canvas?" he finally asked. "One canvas. No need for fifteen blank canvases." Émile had been thinking again. "If you have no artistic ambition, what is your ambition, then?" Marcel, whose dick hung like a sock, blew his smoke "My ambition is to marry four wives. The four most beautiful in the region. Following my technique. Have you seen Claire Lacombe? And Christine de Pizan? What do you say about Manon Roland? Very beautiful? And Madame de Maintenon? All of them will be mine, with a ring on their finger, brides in the house you walk in, Émile!" And, unlike Emil, Emilio and Emilia, Émile had not doubted for a second the success of his friend.

"Our grandparents used to communicate vocally via this device," Jacqueline once told us. "I could even talk to you on your smartphone via this orange box if only there was a dial tone." It was unsettling to imagine this orange plastic device that belonged to dead people connected to our smartphone network. I expected to receive a call from a corpse and shuddered. I got up and walked to the reading room, confused. I had my book under my arm. Bookworm Beatrice was looking at the vehicles below. I approached her. She glared at me, but I told her it was okay. I looked at the yellow truck and the white Ford for a moment. I thought it must be raining. Then I stooped down, grabbed the white Ford, rolled the yellow truck over, and put the car where the truck had been. I got up, kissed Bookworm Beatrice, who was still asking me if I was okay, before going back to watching the two vehicles on the ground.

Then it happened. The noise. Bookworm Beatrice was startled. And Bookworm Claudine leapt into the room. Madame Jacqueline in her window stared at the West Wing.

There was a tapping sound, someone banging on a wooden plate. My heart was pounding, I stopped Bookworm Claudine in her tracks; no: we would go together to the west wing. There, every punch in the wood made the orange device rattle. We had looked up. Someone was banging from the other side of the ceiling hatch at the end of the worm-eaten staircase.

_I stepped forward, the Bookworms watching me, hands over my mouth, as I climbed the worm-eaten stairs. The trap door was above me, the banging deafening me, dust falling into my hair with each punch. I knocked back, and the trap door gave way on my fist. I swung it around, a surprising warmth blew into my face. It was dark under the roof peak. I poked my head through. Then I climbed._
