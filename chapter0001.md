Part One

There are various contradictory versions of the story of the painter Marco di Salvieri. Marco di Salvieri was said to have had four wives—on this point the four Bookworms agree... But from this founding consensus, a veritable tree of discordant facts unfolded. For months now, at the very heart of the book you are reading (and that’s its soul), the life of the polygamous artist has been bitterly debated, divided between four divergent readings, four _flavours_ of the same biographies—four ways of filling in the gaps in history.

When the Bookworm that I am first develops the idea that Di Salvieri, indeed united to four damsels, did not consummate any of his marriages, Bookworm Jacqueline laughs—the candles flicker; her enormous spongy grimoire topples over the desk, she compasses it almost standing up—her index finger hovers over a decomposing page and then taps a bulging nota bene, reading « _the painter was certainly not very tactile_, _but he did honour his four wives, as a man in love would! »—_But when she goes on to tell us about her own chimera, namely that Marcel de Salve was in fact French, and not Italian as I have been claiming since the first meetings, with a sonorous sigh Bookworm Claudine throws her arms in the air, deplores the dishonesty of the various translators on whom the three of us have decidedly stumbled, they who would have taken advantage of their free pen to move the artist's place of residence (probably with the aim of seducing the national readership?)—to Parma, to Catalonia or to the suburbs of Paris—whereas he lived—it is written in a thousand places in her readings—in Salzburg; and that he was Prussian—and that his name was not Marco, Marcel or who knows what—but Markus Von Salviertt! What's more, this Markus, still according to the exhausting "historical" research of Bookworm Claudine—not only honoured his four wives, but by dint of screwing the lot he had turned them into real wenches in his time!—after which we are subjected, by the left and in a learned tone, to a fourth version of the man’s life, who, according to the tedious readings of Bookworm Beatrice, was in reality a woman, a painter it is true, but who walked the Port Vell in the north-east of Spain—and she was called Marcia da Salverio!

And off we went again; our volumes lying flat under our lamps, I whispered my latest discoveries, and they let me talk: Marco di Salvieri (who, I maintained, walked the fields of Emilia-Romagna with an easel on his back), lived on the outskirts of the Duchy of Parma, where he owned a piece of land of which I showed a title deed transcript. It was in this region that he had a discussion one day (or one drunken night, depending on the version) with a friend. His friend, whose name has not been preserved in history, but whom we shall call "Emilio", had told him that he was such a poor painter and that he should definitely do something else with his life. Marco di Salvieri did not deny it; yes, indeed, he was a poor artist, but he pointed out that his easel, his brush and his oily palette always ended up in front of naked and lustful young women, didn’t they? What was the point of being a prodigious artist when a mischievous incompetent could see the same result? This equipment, from easel to stool, allowed him to "strike a pose" as much as his models lying on the wild grass. All he had to do was to modulate an air that was at once inspired, inhabited and tortured—so that the painting could always have its back to them: as long as it was not revealed, Marco would potentially be the greatest artist in Emilia Romagna. But was this a way for him to find a wife, Emilio had asked. Marco di Salvieri had answered "four!", and his friend, who did not see any marriage actually happening, had wondered about the painter's mental health. Di Salvieri passed him the bottle of Grappa and told him that it would not be long before he would see; soon he, Marco di Salvieri, would have four women in his bed, and he would marry all four of them! And a Bourbon-Parma, and an Este, and a Farnese, and a Gonzaga!

Emilio understood the joke and after another sip of wine he asked his friend if he "didn't want anything else with his four wives?"

"What more could I want? To be _good-looking_?" The painter’s tirade was almost a reproach. It was that Marco di Salvieri, who was therefore not talented at all, was not a very handsome man either. _She was indeed a rather common woman,_ confirmed Bookworm Beatrice (always in the learned tone she gave to her interruptions), _to the point where she was early condemned to wanking off drunkards at the exit of the hostels of Port Vell in order to defer her anonymity_. Bookworm Jacqueline, behind her counter, had coughed briefly without taking her eyes off her book. She bent her elbow towards the "silence" sign.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the main room with silent steps._

_Bookworm Beatrice resumes her reading under the lamp. She turns a thick, burnished page._

Marcia da Salverio was a redhead, said Bookworm Beatrice, and this Italian story in no way obscures her life as an immoral paintress from Catalonia—on the contrary; Catalan details, by the Mediterranean, are confirmed. For if this other line of fiction situates her home in Girona, it suggests (at least for two of us contemporary Bookworms, and even if ridiculously so) a certain South-Latin proximity. A Mediterranean plausibility.

_Marcia's anonymity was evasive_, that was a wobbly phrase Bookworm Beatrice had uttered to describe Marco's, Marcia's, Marcel's or Markus' incognito; an adjective that must have been something like _relative anonymity_, but I enjoyed watching Beatrice's eyes peel back her sixth form synonyms.

_Bookworm_ _Beatrice leaves the main hall._

_There is silence._

When silence fell in such a way, the atmosphere in the library changed. Then, I would casually contemplate the volume of gas that Bookworm Jacqueline occupied at the counter. In this cubic metre of sulphur, I thought, perspired Bookworm Jacqueline and her book. She, with her eyes lowered to an indecipherable page, I imagined, her face lit from below, the shadow of her chin on her nose, that of her cheekbones in her eyes, she would remind me of unconscious Pandora opening her box. In this volume of gas, this statue with a large bun and inverted features was perhaps reading a passage that would upset all three of us. I had imagined her unfolding the leather cover on an illumination. Perhaps she was staring at me from underneath too, assessing the relevance of showing me her discovery, this inconceivable turn of events in Marco's life that the rest knew nothing about. My delirium persisted: now she was boiling, reeking of the carbon that emanated from her body; in this volume, her own oxygen was macerating, snaking within itself, a little beige as the perfume of genitals confined for too long, dirty blonde hair waving like seaweed in a spicy soup. I know now that she is staring at me.

_Bookworm Claudine enters the reading room._

_Bookworm Beatrice enters the reading room._

I think of anonymity, I think of the volume of stale air; of our four volumes of stale air, ours, our own, with our own sulphur, our own gas, growing since the distant days of the baths, effluvia that is carried like an endless spicy veil through the reading room, from lamps to shelves, from shelves to lamps. To anonymity. To Marco di Salvieri. To the way he sows us through the pages. To invoke our lies.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the reading room._

_Bookworm Beatrice is lost in contemplation of the vehicles at ground level._ A yellow Caterpillar truck behind a white Ford. I dream that it is raining, I decide that it is raining; that the cobblestones of the streets are black with rain. The voice of Bookworm Claudine reaches us from the vestibule. It's a melody she whispers, maybe it's a song, maybe it's a poem in several tones.

..._The Library and its Bookworms_

_A penumbra marked out by glimmers_

_Where different types of sulphur_

_Can be cooked over time..._

(_Bookworm Beatrice no longer observes the vehicles, she leaves the reading room, and then the singing in the south room no longer reaches me_)_._

Claudine was the last one to lock herself in here. We had watched her for a long time before agreeing that she was indeed a Bookworm. Beatrice and I had surrounded her, almost cornered her. _Do you know what a Bookworm is? It's a little wriggling animal that gnaws on old books. We both think, and so does Madame Jacqueline, that you are a Bookworm, because you wriggle when you read the life of Marco di Salvieri. Of Marcia da Salverio, Beatrice would tell you._ Madame Jacqueline lowers her glasses and whispers _of Marcel de Salve._ Claudine's eyes were black, very large, and she was reading us, stroking the hard, dusty cover of a grey-green volume_._ She seemed to be in a state of shock. We had just told her that her personal and secret lover, Markus Von Salviertt, had other suitors. Her mouth chewed slowly in silence, as if to capture the flavour of the strange names we were calling Markus. _She feels naked, her eyes are gigantic, we have caught her in the act, she will show us her hands to prove that she did not have them between her thighs while reading the adventures of Markus Von Salviertt._

_Claudine had left the reading room._

_Beatrice had left the reading room._

I had watched their waistlines, from behind, as they left for the eastern section, and then I stood alone for a while (with Bookworm Jacqueline at her counter), a strange image in my mind; Bookworm Claudine, I had told myself, her extreme thinness was her asset, not her face. I could have wrapped my tongue around her waspish waist. She, a skinny child, could not have wrapped her arms around mine. To me especially, Claudine had a dream waist. Perhaps she was Marco's Maria Antonia Dorotea, Marcel's Manon Roland—or Maria Lòpes de Luna, that young woman with the famously small waistline that Marcia's biographies apparently inform. I remembered that, according to the same Spanish stories, I was Margarita de Prades, the most generous of all. I unfolded the grey-green cover that Claudine had left behind and looked at the text she had been reading. German. I wondered how one could masturbate over German, but the stains proved me one could.

Bookworms wriggle over rare books, and the four of us were all slithering flesh. This had earned us dates where Jean, Thierry or Ludovic, all of them scruffy, would leap to their feet and swallow air, their fists on a slimy penis. It would take us a long time to realise that we were devoted to Marco. We had all been problematic pukers in our younger days—even Bookworm Beatrice, who preferred girls, had flooded the short chestnut clods of her life, so that in the milieu she even had a "reputation", which, it must be said (she was telling us this in the vestibule, while Madame Jacqueline breathed _silence_ in an exhausted manner, from her counter in the reading room) that this "reputation" had become a more famous asset than Bookworm Claudine's waist.

_Bookworm Claudine enters the reading room. She can be heard sniffing ostentatiously._

_Madame Jacqueline looks up for a moment at Bookworm Claudine._

_Bookworm Beatrice watches the vehicles below. She wishes it would rain. For the shine and the black. But Bookworm Claudine cries, that will do. Let her cry over the yellow truck and the white Ford. She stares at their metallic frame, imagines sudden peaks on the yellow and white aluminium, and the grey of the cobblestones that jerkily turns black._

Madame Jacqueline once waxed lyrical about a book on the back row of a shelf in the North Reading Room. She said 'the north room' rather than 'reading room 2', because the library is in the shape of a cross, a cross of five rooms, from the vestibule to room 2, passing through room 1, the central one, where we have our habits, and she her counter. A north room, a south room, an east room, a west room and a central room. It wasn't complicated, she said, but we still had to think about east and west. The east was the powder room, and the west we didn't really talk about, it didn't have a name, or rather it had a thousand’s, which we kept to ourselves.

The book in question was in French, Madame said, and contained the story of the youth of Marcel de Salve and his four wives. We weren't really listening, because it was that story all over again, and because we were perhaps still wondering whether the West was left or right; but to keep us interested in her monologue no doubt (and that was clever), when she rattled off the four women's names, she pointed in turn at each and every one of us. So I was Claire Lacombe, Bookworm Beatrice was Christine de Pizan, Bookworm Claudine was Manon Roland and she, Madame Jacqueline, was Madame de Maintenon—and then we stared at her.

Her story did not actually take place (she said, at least) in Catalonia, Emilia-Romagna or Salzburg, but in the suburbs of Paris.

Marcel de Salve, in this book (inaccessible, of course—I'm just saying), lived over three centuries in the vicinity of Paris. I think for a moment about Claire Lacombe, of what I might have looked like at the time of the Revolution, and I finally remember well that I had a cardboard false arse indeed, at some point in my lives. Bookworm Beatrice secretly examines her nails, because Madame Jacqueline describes the dirtiness of Christine de Pizan's fingers. Bookworm Claudine seems to be waiting for the moment when Madame will say that "Marcel" has shagged us, but that never happens. Like Markus, like Marco, like Marcia, the cardboard arses of Marcel's wives have never snapped under his attacks. Is this true?

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the reading room._

Two hours later, the four of us were in the east room, the powder room, and we were happily powdering ourselves. Bookworm Claudine turned her head to the side, and so did I, because the sulphur and gas emanating from the brunettes' cunt had reached our noses. Bookworm Beatrice had no doubt heard what Madame was saying about Christine de Pizan, the details of what was going on inside her false arse, and Bookworm Beatrice had begun to scratch herself, her nails would go black that's for sure, it was disgusting of course, but it gave us another opportunity to appreciate the well-built, well-proportioned body of Christine de Pizan—this injustice ran through the generations and the fictions, I had already thought so when she was Vittoria Farnese, and we had started, Bookworm Claudine and I, to powder ourselves furiously, and I could see that we were both thinking of the same thing, that is to say: how could Marco stop himself from buttfucking her—Bookworm Claudine's little pout as she sent the powder to her armpits showed that we were both thinking about the same hole.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the powder room._

_Madame Jacqueline continues to smell like an egg in her wicket, but nothing is said._

Marcel de Salve had been shagging us. I thought he hadn't, but he had. I don't know if Madame made this up to keep our attention or if it was because this version of Marco di Salvieri was a Frenchman, or better still, because we were Frenchwomen and it was well known. The story was that Marcel de Salve had a good friend, whose name remains a mystery, and that one day the painter predicted that his paintings would bring him four wives. To which the friend, whom we shall call "Émile", had slapped his thigh "Ah!" But Marcel knew what he was doing; he was ugly, but he was clever, and he had piled up four wives in his Boulogne home. Bookworm Beatrice, in a falsely detached manner, wanted to know how precisely he shagged us, well, how he shagged Christine de Pizan for example, but Madame Jacqueline looked evasive, the back of her hand wandering to the inaccessible rows of shelves, those at the very top, out of reach of our outstretched arms, plunged into the absolute darkness. Maybe one day we'll be able to tell—who knows?—if the worm-eaten shelves end up collapsing, vomiting onto the library floor those tomes we think we can see up there. Bookworm Beatrice seemed to be interested in that part of Marcia da Salverio's biography where it is stated that the paintress tried her hand at one and only one man, having been content, as the Bookworm liked to point out a little too often, to jerk off the drunkards here and there. "We agree, she said, that wanking off drunkards is not true love, or else I've known true love a very long time ago, and I didn’t enjoy it that much." At least, I told myself, she, Beatrice, had known true love.

_Bookworm Claudine leaves the reading room for the north room._

Madame Jacqueline becomes a confidante. We are both almost face to face. "Madame de Maintenon was Marcel's first." Old cunt. Old blunderbuss. She sailed down the rows that Bookworm Claudine was trying to reach in the north room.

_We had won the southern section._

We chewed our meat in silence. I gnawed the brown shin-like pieces, remembering the books about Marco di Salvieri’s youth. I stared at the mirror where an enormous Elisabeth of Parma reflected back her bovine eye. To a question from Bookworm Beatrice to Bookworm Claudine (which I heard but did not listen to), the latter replied "Ja, Ja, sicher," and Madame and Bookworm Beatrice gave an amused snort, and Bookworm Claudine did not understand at once "Was gibts?" then she put her two hands over her mouth and giggled to herself, delighted.

After dinner our reading resumed. We were all lost in the silence of the central room, the sporadic sliding of parchment chapters punctuated the afternoon, until the evening poured. Every day we tried to glean new information about Marco, about Marcia, about Markus or about Marcel, and it never occurred to me that the information I was gleaning always concerned Marco di Salvieri; never Marcia, Markus or Marcel. And that it was the same for the others—each of us seemed to only come across the elaborations of our own version. Sometimes a sound of cracking wood, three faces would rise, and we would observe a back and an arm stretched towards a high shelf. We could hardly reach the sixth level; only Madame Jacqueline, that giraffe of a woman, managed to reach the seventh level on the tips of her toes. Of course, we could each see an eighth level, hidden in almost total darkness. It was impossible to see any higher. Of course, that was precisely where the possibility existed. All possibilities. That I was the favourite of Marco's four wives. That he had a taste for curvaceous women. That he made me two children. That in the evenings he would beat my arse like a psychotic butcher.

I have left off the description of the West Wing, the famous West Wing, the pinnacle of this story, the threshold we never dare cross, "and in there will be the last volume of each of Marco di Salvieri's versions, in which everything will become clear to the Bookworms and the reader."

_Bookworm Beatrice gains the West Wing._

No; the West Wing is not a place to deflower after overcoming our irrational fears, closing this quadruple swoon story with a nimble fall. It isn’t.

The West Wing is the place we shit in. The place where we shit, piss and masturbate. We go there one at a time, when possible; it's a last coquetry we allow ourselves as respectable wives.

_Bookworm Beatrice leaves the West Wing._

By dint of entering this cesspool, we manage to feel who precisely preceded us there, even if we eat the same thing. Or what she did there. And often how much.

But here too is our mausoleum; four small mounds to the glory of our husband. This is how I learned what the yellow and red flag of Catalonia looked like. And where I learned to appreciate Bookworm Claudine's photo montages. Among the candles, underneath the Prussian flag, are famous people in black and white glued on a background reminiscent of Tyrol. That's Claudine's idea of _him_. Markus is tall, dark and sarcastic, and reminds me of a star from the last century. Maybe he's a young Justin Bieber, but I don't ask. I couldn't bear it if she asked me, if _I_ were making schoolgirl-style photo montages. And then, in these effluvia, when you have your hand between your thighs, you sometimes want to let yourself think that photography existed during the Black Plague. You don't know anything for sure, you just feel yourself leaving, and then it's Marco di Salvieri, his fingers on his dark glasses, his jacket on his shoulder, displaying a smile that knows exactly what you're doing with the other hand.

There are also a number of out-of-order appliances piled up here. Old radios, as far as I know. A round black tray with a gigantic metal flower stuck in it by a thin needle. An orange plastic device with twisted wiring and a white disc with holes and numbers in it. There's a bell inside and the top part comes off. Old Madame Jacqueline is the only one who could really tell what these things were for. And then there is this condemned floor, probably the attic of the library. A rudimentary staircase leads to a small trapdoor through which my pond would probably not fit. Sometimes I think about the rain falling directly under the roof of this attic. I let myself dream about it. By the time I reach the bottom of the small staircase, my boots are soaking in four different flavours of shit—four different ways of turning Frolic into a stringy paste.

Marcia the redhead, from her Catalan surname Da Salverio, had accumulated four marriages, thwarting the prognosis of her best friend (whom we shall call Emilia), to whom she had early on mentioned her plans. She had told her that she was the "Paintress" and that this singularity at the time had earned her the confidence of a certain type of women, embarrassed by the male gaze of their father's or uncle's painters. Emilia that day was washing Marcia's red hair and, standing behind her, she gauged her friend's expression from above. Cautiously, Emilia asked, "Who are you thinking of marrying, my dear?" and she heard Marcia's smile click. "Sibylle de Fortià, first of all, for her plastic beauty; Margarita de Prades, for her morphological generosity; Maria López de Luna, because she prefers men. And my last prey is none other than Joseph, because he too prefers men." Emilia had swallowed air: Joseph Bergler, it was a gamble for him to marry a lady. However, Marcia did marry all four, and lived for many years painting naked bodies and drowning boats on the Port Vell.

We powdered ourselves in a cathedral-like silence. Madame Jacqueline would go round her yellow mare's teeth with her pommel, pass over her shoulders, dabbing mint into the shiny gutter between her breasts. The rest of us were there once a month because Madame was there; as if the meeting had to take place contractually. Bookworm Beatrice stood and anointed her entire body with a film of soap, the beautiful body that Bookworm Claudine and I always looked at in fascinated silence. I waited for Bookworm Claudine to take off her trousers, to admire her waistline, which my brain couldn't seem to accept, as if it was thirsting for this inconceivable model image. We might have smelled of mint in the powder room, but we were only guessing, for we could smell nothing. The cathedral-like silence continued. Then, with the tip of a lung, Bookworm Claudine asked a question. We all turned to Madame Jacqueline, for it seemed implicit that the question should be put to her. Madame Jacqueline continued to powder herself, and this went on for a few minutes. Then she summed up the question: "Does magic exist?", and Bookworm Claudine said "_Real_ magic". I think that if Bookworm Claudine had asked the two of us, and not Madame, we would have gone on about mercury, sulphur and salt, and that we had been immersed in this alchemy for months. But Madame Jacqueline was staring at Bookworm Claudine in the mirror without a smile, and one sensed that the answer would have to do with books. "Real magic, of course it exists. You're in it; we're in it. Don't you think so?"

_Madame Jacqueline will tell us a story._

"I will tell you a story. When I was a little girl, I read _The Adventures of Daria Devushka_ by Debor Konstantinov. It was a seven-volume saga, but, importantly, while I was reading it, like all other young readers, I didn't know that there would be more than one volume, didn't know that it was actually a long saga in the making. When I finished that book, I burst into incredulous tears, because at the last page, in place of the word "END", there was a sentence informing a sequel to the Adventures of Daria Devushka. A sequel that would be released the following year. Then I was plunged into a strange state, a second state of euphoria and love, of impatience and infinite possibilities. Of hope. Of faith. It was this phase, my first contact with real magic, my dear Bookworms. The discovery of a sequel, or the promise of one, when you think you're done with the greatest story in the world. More generally: the awareness of a future of which we know nothing and in which everything is possible—even by definition the impossible. For Debor Konstantinov's elaboration of true magic did not stop there. The author was lying on his deathbed when he scratched out the last sentences of his seventh volume years later. And before he drew his last breath, knowing full well that he would not live through the night, he wrote a very, very last sentence in place of the word ‘END’, in that seventh volume. His widow discovered it, stained with blood, shortly after the funeral, when she packed up her late husband's last papers and filed the scattered sheets of his last manuscript. This sentence was ‘The continuation of The Adventures of Daria Devushka will be discovered in volume 8 to be published at an undetermined date.’ That's the real magic." Madame looked at us one after the other in the mirror, and we all just stood there, we stayed like that. When she put on her glasses, she added, "And we, here in the library, don't live anything else; we wait for the next volume. We know it is there, among the thousands of accessible books, or the hundred or so inaccessible books in the eighth level. Or ninth? Books in the dark. The continuation of the adventures of Marco, Markus, Marcia and Marcel. It's all here, and let me tell you something: if _The Adventures of Daria Devushka_ were seven volumes long, our husband’s number of volumes is far too many for us to have enough time in our lives to read it all. That's just it—real magic exists, and all four of us are in the grip of the Library's magic."

Tonight I saw Bookworm Beatrice standing on a small table in front of one of the shelves in the northern section. Her body was pressed against the spine of the accessible books and she was reaching for the seventh shelf. In her hand I could see a wooden spoon, which she seemed to be scraping one more level up.

Once a week we have a kind of meeting. We pull the desks out of the central room and sit in a circle on the floor on the Persian carpet. A mound of candles is formed in the centre of this circle, and sometimes we put a particular volume on it, sometimes just candles. And we meditate, our eyes on the three faces around us. That night, in the middle of the circle, the Prussian mausoleum of Justin Bieber was placed. It was a brass totem pole, which presented us with the black and white photo of Tyrol, which we rotated on a moving tray. The Franco-Italian-Prussian-Catalan painter was posted at the foot of the mountains, and we didn't know when the photograph might have been taken, but Marco looked debonair and rather unaffected by the apparent cold of the snowy scene. He was in a light shirt, casual, his jacket thrown over his shoulder, and he wore dark glasses over a smile that told us "I know, I know, I understand, don't faint!" We each shivered with cold as the tray turned, then Marco finally faced me. The contemplative silence continued, and the tray had gone around the slow circle maybe thirty times. It was now in front of Bookworm Claudine, and on the other side of the candles Claudine's eyes glistened like a lake on fire. Pure, raw love; I imagined her huge heart, her gaping cunt, and it wasn't hard to imagine at that moment.

_Marcel de Salve did not really live in Paris, but Madame Jacqueline could imagine, and rightly so, that we would not really know the difference between the City of Light and Boulogne._ For it was in an inn in Boulogne that Marcel and his friend, whom we shall call Émile, were remaking the world. Marcel painted gourds (according to Émile) and fornicated often, and almost systematically. When morning came and Marcel turned the gourd from his hay, Émile was surprised to find a blank canvas on the easel. "You haven't painted anything, Marcel? Why then did that gourd jump around your cock?" Marcel, who didn't bother to get dressed (or to wash himself, Émile noticed), stood at the window and thoughtfully filled his pipe: "It's the pose that does it, my good Émile." And Émile wondered how the pose of the gourds could generate in them a desire to fornicate with a painter who did not paint her at all. "Not the gourd pose, Émile; my own pose. The one I mime, the one of the inspired artist at his easel. They don't want to know how I don't paint them; besides, I don't show them until it's finished; and since I don't finish or start, in that I'm very fair!" Émile sat still, thinking a little. "You have only one canvas?" he finally asked. "One canvas. No need for fifteen blank canvases." Émile had been thinking again. "If you have no artistic ambition, what is your ambition, then?" Marcel, whose dick hung like a sock, blew his smoke "My ambition is to marry four wives. The four most beautiful in the region. Following my technique. Have you seen Claire Lacombe? And Christine de Pizan? What do you say about Manon Roland? Very beautiful? And Madame de Maintenon? All of them will be mine, with a ring on their finger, brides in the house you walk in, Émile!" And, unlike Emil, Emilio and Emilia, Émile had not doubted for a second the success of his friend.

"Our grandparents used to communicate vocally via this device," Jacqueline once told us. "I could even talk to you on your smartphone via this orange box if only there was a dial tone." It was unsettling to imagine this orange plastic device that belonged to dead people connected to our smartphone network. I expected to receive a call from a corpse and shuddered. I got up and walked to the reading room, confused. I had my book under my arm. Bookworm Beatrice was looking at the vehicles below. I approached her. She glared at me, but I told her it was okay. I looked at the yellow truck and the white Ford for a moment. I thought it must be raining. Then I stooped down, grabbed the white Ford, rolled the yellow truck over, and put the car where the truck had been. I got up, kissed Bookworm Beatrice, who was still asking me if I was okay, before going back to watching the two vehicles on the ground.

Then it happened. The noise. Bookworm Beatrice was startled. And Bookworm Claudine leapt into the room. Madame Jacqueline in her window stared at the West Wing.

There was a tapping sound, someone banging on a wooden plate. My heart was pounding, I stopped Bookworm Claudine in her tracks; no: we would go together to the west wing. There, every punch in the wood made the orange device rattle. We had looked up. Someone was banging from the other side of the ceiling hatch at the end of the worm-eaten staircase.

_I stepped forward, the Bookworms watching me, hands over my mouth, as I climbed the worm-eaten stairs. The trap door was above me, the banging deafening me, dust falling into my hair with each punch. I knocked back, and the trap door gave way on my fist. I swung it around, a surprising warmth blew into my face. It was dark under the roof peak. I poked my head through. Then I climbed._

Part Two

I was standing in the dark, with headphones on. A long metal rod in front of me was falling from the ceiling. That was all I could make out. It was my whole world at that moment. That, and the microphone, encircled by a hoop. The silence was total.

Then the music poured in the headphones, and I began to hit the beat with my fingertip. And I opened my throat. A warm, gaping clang. On the fourth beat of my index finger, my vocal cords began to vibrate. Precisely for three minutes and fifteen seconds. And then we did it again, for another three minutes and fifteen seconds. And again. And again.

A taxi is waiting for me outside the studio. It's dark, it's raining. I feel far from home. I am far from home.

"It's for the hotel..." I wanted to say, but the driver told me that he had come especially for this transit, and that the way to the Ramada Hotel was clear, only ten minutes away. He was happy, he told me, to have an international artist as a client. I kept quiet, we were driving. The grey facades that passed by were the same grey as in Paris. The headlights of the cars were strangely white. We stopped. I got out of the taxi, told myself that the driver had been paid, but I wanted to give him something. I could see him driving his black Mercedes down the unfamiliar boulevard, and then I could only see his red taillights, when he had stopped maybe a hundred metres away, in front of a pedestrian crossing. The pedestrian crossing was riddled with phosphorescent rain on the ground.

At the reception of the Ramada Hotel, I told my name, but the receptionist just asked me if I wanted something special for dinner. I said no, and then, like yesterday, took the lift.

I walked down the long corridor on the second floor, untying my bow tie. When I reached the door, I closed my eyes and mentally thought "203", then opened them again. In front of me, on the door, was screwed the number 203. I had been afraid to forget this detail too quickly. I had a phone call to make, during which I would have to fill in this room number.

The room seemed large to me, but it was not exactly luxurious. It was yellowish, olive and greenish, colours before the amputation. I sat down on the bed, next to the bedside table. I took out the little black notebook and put one hand on the orange telephone receiver. "203, 33, XX XX Boulogne" I thought. I picked up the phone.

The operator had a slight accent, she seemed young. I asked to be put on 33 XX XX in Boulogne.

"You are in 32", said the young operator, "you know the prices for 33 from 32?"

"I don't care, kid," I smiled.

"Of course sir, I'll put you through to XX XX in Boulogne, international call in 33 from 32. Hold on."

"Hello?" came Claire's voice. So it was Claire who picked up. Perfect.

"It's me," I said. Claire breathed a sigh of relief.

"How did it go, the recording?"

I struck a match, lit a Gitane, blew smoke.

"It was okay, I guess. They let me out."

"So you’re coming back?"

"No, I have to shoot a musical film for another song at..." I was looking for the information in my notebook, "at the Palais des Congrès."

"When?"

"Tomorrow. Can you come?"

"Do you want me to come?" Claire sounded happy that I asked her that.

"You take the Ford, you cross the border, you're there tomorrow."

Claire thought for a moment.

"And if I hadn't been the one to take the call, would you have told the others that?"

"Yes, my dear, I would have told them the same thing, out of courtesy. But I was hoping that you would be the one to pick up the phone."

"Hmmm, why the Ford?"

"Because all the cars here are sadly dark."

"What'll the song be? Will there be girls?"

"Well, no. Here they want to promote the place; it must have been built recently. The Palais des Congrès will be empty, and the film crew has asked me to walk alone and sing."

"Why?" said Claire.

"Hmmm, I have to walk through as many rooms as possible, to show the new building. They wanted a star, my little one. A French star who sings in a new building."

"You're a star, Poussin. Do people recognise you in the streets? Women?"

"I haven't seen much of anyone. I have to get up early tomorrow, so I'll leave you; but I expect to find you at the hotel when I get back. I'll give you the address, will you write it down?"

"Go ahead."

"So, it is on the boulevard de la Sauvenière, as it's pronounced, at number 100, all round, in Liège. The Ramada Hotel. I’m in room 203, you’ll remember that? You give your name to the reception, understood?"

"All right, I’ll get ready, Poussin."

"Claire?"

"Yes?"

"Be careful, I love you, my little one."

It was still raining when the black taxi stopped in front of the Ramada Hotel. It was early, the cobblestones on the boulevard were black and shiny. The white headlights of the dark cars transported me further away from Paris. I tried to hold on to the timeline; the sixties seemed to be unfolding here, in the hairstyles and skirts of the women, as they did in Paris. Passing cars sizzled on the wet pavement. I got into the taxi.

"To the Palais des Congrès, please."

"Of course, sir."

I kept quiet. After a few blocks, the driver asked:

"Are you French?"

"Yes."

"Do you have any belgian francs on you?"

"No, I've only got french coins in my pocket, and I say that, I'm not even sure. The director is sending you, right?"

"Yes, he is. Is he at the Palais des Congrès?"

"Why, of course," I said.

"I hope he can afford the fare."

I raised my eyebrows in silence, then we drove on without saying anything more.

The Palais des Congrès was indeed a new building, immaculate and completely deserted. I met the director at the bar; no boom operator, it wouldn't be a live shot, he told me. "We'll just shoot, and my assistant will follow the cameraman with a tape player that will play the song, so you'll be in sync."

I asked if I could smoke during the shoot; he told me that we were going to do several takes, to get all the parts, and that it would be a problem for me to smoke, because the length of my cigarette would inevitably change from one shot to another.

I lit a Gitane while waiting to be told to start walking along the rooms of the Palais des Congrès. I understood perfectly well that I wasn't being offered alcohol, but I had a serious craving for a little whisky, like that one, the one that was delicately moistening in that square bottle behind the barman. All the bottles in these mirrors were giving me the eye, really, and the director was drinking his amber glass, making his little sips clatter on his palate. The cameraman and the tape carrier, punished as I was, stared at me with a complicit desolation.

We went up to the top floor, "because it will be less tiring for you and my cameraman to walk down them, as we have to film the beautiful stairs."

At one point he said "in 30 minutes the light will be good, and hopefully for at least three hours."

At 11 o'clock I had my hands in my pockets, at the very beginning of the corridor. The cameraman stood at an angle, the tape maker tested the tape. My song could hardly be heard, unlike the car horns coming from outside.

"Should I keep my hands in my pockets?"

"You'll tend to want to get them out, over a three-hour period, so no; to be consistent with the plans, you know? Take a very natural attitude, one that you can easily keep for three hours."

Then I walked, trying to look casual. The cameraman walked at the same angle, backwards, his steps clattering against the beat of my song. The tape guy walked normally, whispering lyrics to the director, while I sang into the echo of the concrete, over my own almost inaudible voice on the tape.

We were going down the stairs, and I could hear the footsteps of the three men. When my song was finished, we rewound it and continued our journey through the empty Palais des Congrès.

I woke up with a start. The phone was ringing. I got up, rubbed my eyes. I picked up the phone.

"Hello?"

"Good evening, sir; a Mademoiselle Lacombe is here."

"_Madame_ Lacombe. Send her up, thank you."

"Will you have something? Do you want to eat together?"

"Ask Madame Lacombe what she wants to eat, and bring me the same, thank you."

"Very well, sir. Have a good evening."

I stretched; it was almost dark, a bit blue. It was warm in the room. I turned on the bedside lamp, then tried the buttons around the bed. A chandelier lit up.

"Poussin!" Claire jumps on my neck. Her skin is cold, she smells good, her slim body fits into mine, I inhale her hair, I am in autumn. She spins around in the middle of the room, her arms spread wide. "I've never been to this city before, well, maybe I passed through it without knowing it when I was in Amsterdam..."

"Sit down. I've only just woken up. How was the drive?"

"Normal. A bit long. I had lunch in a restaurant on the border. It was fun. I had a good time. How was your shoot?"

"I walked and walked. I sang out of tune for three hours in a disgusting echo of fresh concrete."

"Out of tune?" Claire stretched out on a sofa, took off her shoes.

"Don't take your clothes off, they'll bring dinner. What did you ask?"

"They had a carte, it was complex, they told me that you would take the same thing as me, so I was a bit stupid in front of the menu; I don't know what I took."

I sat down next to her, kissed her bare arm. Then I lay down.

"Did you see that the headlights of the cars are white?" I asked.

"That car headlights are white?" Claire seemed to think that she (or I) had lost the thread of the discussion.

"I've had a lonely couple of days," I said, then, still lying down, I lifted her hand and nibbled her fingertips.

"We'll make love," she said, turning her head towards the bed. I could see in her eyes that she was imagining our bodies embracing.

"Yes, we will have sex."

"Olympe wanted to come," it was almost an anecdote. I didn't know what to say. I could have wanted Olympe, for example, to join us. It was a bit complicated to react without lying a bit.

"We could have fucked the five of us like in Boulogne, I don't think they care here," I thought I'd say.

"I don't feel like _fucking_ tonight, Émile; we're abroad, and I treasure having you here for a while. I want you to make love to me. I don't want to fuck, Poussin, I want you."

"It's true, excuse me. This is not Boulogne."

There was a knock on the door.

We were at the table, subtly lit by electric candles. The tablecloth was white, a bellboy was unloading the trolley onto it. I don't really know what was on our plates, I questioned Claire with my eyes, she was just assessing the dish, almost apologetic. The bellman spoke, he said the names of the dishes, but I didn't understand. Then he said "Monsieur de Salve, Mademoiselle Lacombe, bon appétit!" Then he went out pulling his cart. I didn't have time to correct the bellboy. Did he not see my wife's wedding ring?

"At least you chose the right wine, my dear."

"The cook picked it out; he said it went with this," she gestured.

"So _this_ can't be that bad," I said.

We made love, and it was really good. I had almost forgotten this exclusive intimacy with one of my wives. I didn't miss any of my spouses who were absent; and for the first time since I had crossed the border, I didn't miss Boulogne. We fell asleep happy. Tomorrow we would return to France.

I woke up, it was still dark. Émile was still sleeping. I slowly pulled myself out of his arms and went to the bathroom. The neon light hurt my eyes. I stared at myself in the mirror. I could still hear that voice. I still haven't told Émile about that. Or anyone.

My clothes were folded by the bath. I sat naked on the toilet bowl. I tried to think about the situation, but nothing came to mind, except that I was definitely not thinking about anything. Something was wrong. I got dressed and walked out of the bathroom in silence. I went to the room door and found myself in the dimly lit hallway. My watch said 5:30. I rushed down the stairs; I didn't really know where I was going; or, strangely enough, I did know precisely. I wasn't going to many places, I was going to that one place... In the hall, the receptionist didn't see me at once. Then he said:

"Are you going to get some fresh air, Mademoiselle Lacombe? Do you know what time you'll be back?"

I had this impulse to tell him I would never be back, but I contained myself and said, "I'm just going for a walk on the boulevard."

"Alright, miss. Don't catch cold. Here's an umbrella."

I grabbed the umbrella and walked out. I walked along the boulevard, whose name I had forgotten. Boulevard di Salvieri? Boulevard de Salvière? De la Sauvenière? How it sounds.

In this night, the headlights of the cars were white. I had heard that information before, and I had to concentrate to remember Émile had made that remark to me. I kept on walking and realise I hadn't opened the umbrella. Then, the umbrella was lying on the cobblestones a hundred metres behind me.

When I look at my watch, illuminated by red, green and blue pulses, under impressive music, it marks 11:45. I am in a bar. I wonder if it is 11:45 in the evening. I've walked a long way, I don't know where I am. I know where I am. Men offer me drinks and I drink them. Some are my age. Others are of age. The lyrics of the songs that play seem to be addressed to me. As if it were still that voice. That voice singing instead of talking in my head. A new glass arrives on the zinc, a tall man is standing, he waves his beer at me. How dare any of them accost me? I am a married woman. I am one of Émile Starlight's wives! I take my hand to this new glass that is offered to me and drink it in one gulp. My slender fingers around the glass no longer hold the wedding ring. I snap them at the tall dark-haired man.

I'm in the bathroom of this bar, and I feel like I've been there ten times tonight. Behind me, the tall dark-haired guy is working, holding my hair, then he's done, and I go back to the bar again.

I've lost something, myself, it's not right at all. My watch reads 5:30 again, and I realise it's been twelve hours, or 24 hours, since I left Émile. I'm sitting on the bowl of the bar's toilet, but there's someone already sitting there, bare hairy legs on the back of my thighs, and I slowly slide until he comes. It's 11:45 again. I am outside. The visceral panic, which has always been my safeguard, has left me. I think I won't make it, but I also think it doesn't matter anymore.

It's 5:30 a.m., I wake up in a bed, a man snoring next to me. It's not Émile. It's a guy from the bar. We are in an attic. A bed in an attic. A mattress on the floor. I get dressed slowly, then I look for the exit, the staircase, there is none, there is no exit, there never was; there is a trap door on the floor, I want to lift it, it resists me, I bang on the trap door, it lasts a long time; then the door tips over, and I go down a worm-eaten staircase. There, Olympe, Manon and Christine stare at me.

"So what was it?" asks Olympe.

I leave the west wing and go to the central reading room. I don't know if it was the wind hitting the hatch, but I think we all got the fright of our lives. Bookworm Claudine starts reading again, and so does Bookworm Beatrice. As for Madame Jacqueline, she yawns at her window.

Part Three

A whistle blew on the foggy platform of the Boulogne station. The carriage shook. A young mother and her little girl entered the compartment; I pulled my legs under the seat. In this first movement of the scenery, the young mother was pulling the sliding door. We were back in a jar. The girl in her skirts, one eye wide open on me, was trying to keep control of everything that was rushing around her, the deafening mechanics, the giant strangers, the emanation of oils, the monster that creaked and bellowed and then, finally, this strange metal house in which they had climbed, no doubt, I thought, for the very first time, that she would never forget, that would shape her, that would propel her a little further towards the age of reason. We greeted each other with a polite smile, I looked down at the tape I was handling. Then Boulogne was swallowed up by a bridge, and by the miles, and we were off to the north. I dozed off a bit.

At about 6 o'clock, I was awakened by the lighting of the lamps in the compartment. The young mother had her chin resting in her palm and was looking out of the window at the frantic projection of the shooting trees. The girl was still staring at me, with both eyes now. I straightened up, perhaps mumbled a strange "Excuse me". The young mother adjusted the sleeves of her daughter's jumper. The girl was talking, to no one in particular, as children do. She had a record clutched between her arms, she seemed to want to show me her treasure. I played the game, looked at it; it was a Henri Dès song, and it made me smile; I said softly to her, "I know the man who sings", and she seemed to find my sentence very strange: she knew him too, she listened to him all the time. I simply said to the mother, "I interviewed Henri Dès last week in Montpellier, that's what I meant; it's not important, I'm waking up." The mother had an unexpected smile, she leaned towards her daughter to tell her, in their own words, that I had met Henri Dès for real, that I had shaken his hand, that he was a friend. I wouldn't have gone that far. The young mother went back to the window, she looked at me out of the corner of her eye, no doubt wondering if I was known myself.

"I'm a music journalist, nothing mysterious," I said. The mother turned to me.

"Have you interviewed any stars I know?" She said this less out of politeness, it seemed to me, than out of genuine awe.

"You and I took the train from Boulogne; well, I was coming back from an interview with a well-known Boulonnais...".

"Oh really, who?" It seemed astonishing to her that a Boulonnais was well-known.

"Émile Starlight. We spent the morning and then lunch reminiscing about the good old days."

"Émile Starlight..." She seemed a little disappointed that it didn't ring a bell.

"Émile Sarlotte!" the child pushed. The mother smiled at me and said, "No, not Madame _Sarlotte,_" then to me, "Madame Charlotte is her teacher..." I thought for a while. This young mother must not have known the sixties, or she was a baby then.

"Émile Starlight was a star of the Yéyés. I was sent by the magazine to interview him about his _comeback_ this year."

"I've probably heard this singer without listening to him," she lamented. But her eyes were not done with me. I felt compelled to add:

"I was sent to see Émile Starlight because he's an old childhood friend; I lived through his early days, and the early days of his success. I can totally understand why the 80s forgot about him a bit."

"And this is the only Star you know personally?"

"As a true friend, yes; I've shaken hands with famous singers, of course, but in '62 he was the most famous of them all."

"And the interview went well? She stayed on topic, strangely.

"I took notes; I recorded a tape," I felt like I sounded very mysterious. The young mother reached out to me.

"My name is Denise, and this is Stephanie," the kid was still looking at me, probably articulating in her mind the idea that Henri Dès was a person you could meet for real, that he wasn't just a song on her record.

"Hello Stéphanie... I'm Marcel," I said to the girl, addressing both of them.

"Like Monsieur Marcel?" the little girl said to me.

"I am another Monsieur Marcel," I smiled.

"Monsieur Marcel is my _good friend,_" said Denise, with an undertone which invited me to talk about something else, that is to say especially not about the girl's father.

"You live in the north, Denise," I said.

"We are Belgians, we live in Liège," she said.

"I don't know Liège," I confessed, "but Émile Starlight recorded a video clip there at the height of his career."

"That's funny, well, how is your star friend?"

I was a bit evasive, we passed under a bridge, we saw each other very yellow in the compartment.

"I would say that your reaction when I gave his name sums up 1982's idea of Émile Starlight quite well; his mental health matches this new anonymity. When I was asked to go and find him, I found it hard to believe in any kind of _comeback_, to tell the truth. I found Émile very (I looked at the girl to choose my words) _…_ »

"Depressed?" Denise stared at me, I nodded.

"Yes, he is. I found him in his pavilion in Boulogne, completely empty—that is, both the pavilion and Émile were completely empty. There had been hope in his eyes in the first moments, when he had seen me, when he had hugged me, I was a remnant of his glorious past—a _proof—_and I was there, 1962 was there, in the middle of a gigantic and scattered living room. My presence may have suggested to him, just for a moment, that bringing 1962 back was possible—after all I was a piece of that old puzzle; then of course an hour in and he was already sagging. So yes, depressed. I saw the depression in his whole being, entirely. I saw the emptiness, the torment, in the way he led me to his big couch and sat on it, taking up so little space, on the edge of his cushion still wrapped in the plastic bag; in the way he was miserable there, physically small, puny, with his hands simply clasped, like those of a condemned innocent. His hands, his silent eyes fixed on my knees, his reduced body, all of this called out to me for help."

"How could he make a _comeback_, your friend? I don't want to press the issue if you don't want to talk about it, but I'm intrigued that such a decision has been made." Denise had laid her coat over the girl, who had fallen asleep with Henri Dès in her arms.

"His record company has a habit of releasing boxed sets for the 20th anniversary of the greatest hits. They surveyed the radio stations, which confirmed that no one in 82 was asking for Émile Starlight anymore. The record company offered to play his hits again, with the promise that new material would be released soon, and on their station first."

"But what material?"

"Recordings that the record company owns. From the back of drawers. They made an inventory, and they almost had enough to compile half a new album. By pushing a little on the collaborations with young artists—Balavoine, Goldman, Téléphone...—they could almost complete the project. That's what they promised the radio stations."

"And as far as I know nothing was heard," Denise stroked her daughter's forehead.

"That's where I come in. I'm contacted because the record company wants at least one new track to finish the album, and they phone my employer, promising an exclusive for a series of articles. My editor is dubious, but I end up on a train to Boulogne."

"And what was your plan?"

"I had a plan, yes; and I implemented it."

"And... did it work?" Denise crossed her arms, like at the movies when an important scene is playing out. My gaze is lost in the shadows of the trees that pass by the window.

"During the sixties, Émile and I were two young guys, always staying with each other. He was already living in Boulogne, but in a house as miserable as mine. We had a band, he on vocals, a friend on guitar, my brother on bass, and me on drums. It was more of a "pose" than a real band. But we soon realised that for Émile it was different. He wanted to be on stage, he wanted the crowd, he wanted the women. My brother eventually stopped coming to rehearsals, and then the friend declined more and more often. Émile and I were drinking our first beers that night—the night our band ended. I was a bit sorry, but he was celebrating. It was his chrysalis. He told me that he had put an advert in a local paper. He was going to audition four girls, and that would be his band: him, and four dancers. If you ever see an old Émile Starlight concert, Denise, you'll see a tall, dark-haired man dressed in stars, swaying to four leggy, phantasmagorical beauties. It was on TV pretty quickly; it was very visual. It was all visual. Are you sure Stephanie is asleep?" Denise had stared at me, then realised I was about to get to the heart of the matter.

"You worry me..." She had said this as if she was rather fascinated.

"That's showbiz," I said. "Émile, on the night the band ended, when he told me about his new project, told me that not only was he going to hire four young bombshells, but that they would be _his_. Yes, _his_. I doubted his project, of course, but everything fell into place; it was as if he was _inhabited_. The group _Émile Starlight and the Worms_ was born, and I could sum up what happened during its successful years as terribly _unhealthy_."

"And... did he make them _his own_?" Denise had her arms crossed, but her chest bent forward to get the answer in a whisper.

"He _married_ all four," I said. Denise lifted her chest, folded her back on the back of the seat. I continued:

"Émile de Salve became Émile Starlight overnight. He had coloured his hair, made clothes for himself out of the silk of curtains he had bought by the metre, and painted them with stars. I helped him to sew all this white silk. Then he asked me to sew skirts, and as we used to say, he wanted them so short that I felt I was sewing belts that were a bit wide. Then I started to see the girls marching in, which he would bring to his father's shed. They had to put on the white silk skirts, come rain or shine, and Émile would stare at them as they undressed—he thought it was part of the audition. I didn't see it all, fortunately."

"My God..."

"I won't go into details, but in the end there were four girls left, they were known by a stage name, but for me they were above all young girls who played cards in his garage; they were Jacqueline, Claudine, Béatrice and Christelle; nice naive girls, totally lost. I worried about them a lot, until one day I lost track of everything and there was no more Émile de Salve at all—there was only _Émile Starlight and his four Worms_, wiggling around on Guy Lux and Drucker's television sets. The concerts. The first album. The second album. I followed it all with increasing distance. Émile called me from time to time, but less and less. And then everything changed," I said dramatically.

"Changed... How the hell?"

"It was in Liège, I think, that the first _Bookworm_ left Émile. As I said, he shot a video clip there. One of his wives met him there in a hotel. And, as far as I know, he went back to Boulogne alone. He phoned me and said, ’It's over with Claire’."

"Claire?"

"It was Christelle's stage name. One of the girls he had almost pulled out of the gutter with his ad. That was the beginning of the end. In the interviews he had to invent reasons for Claire's absence, and these reasons kept changing. Then he had to find reasons for the absences of Manon, then Olympe, then Christine. The 1970s were a long dry spell for Émile Starlight, but at least the radio stations kept playing his greatest hits."

"I don't see what you could do by returning to Boulogne to your friend, ten years after the end of the cabbage. What did you have in mind, in fact? Did you have a way of provoking an electroshock?" Denise was leading me to the central point, and I took a breath.

« I did, yes. I had one last hope. I had seen a programme in which a fellow journalist went to Jacques Brel's house and asked him to write a song spontaneously, in front of the microphone. Jacques Brel sat down at his piano and, in front of the journalist, he simply wrote one of his best songs. He had to polish the result, of course, but the material was there: Brel had captured the moment, had created a work from nothing. That was the magic of live performance."

"That's what you tried to do with Émile Starlight." It was not a question.

"That's what I tried to do with Émile Starlight. This morning he said this strange thing to me: ’I accept this nothingness I'm falling into, because I have a pretty good memory of my last depression.’"

"That's terrible. It's very true, too," Denise repeated the sentence twice.

"I took Émile to his piano, which had gathered dust from not being used at all. He was tiny in front of the instrument. And he said to me ‘You know, Marcel, you know... It's as if I were going to spend the next night in a haunted house... But I'm going in all the same, serene; for it's none other than _my_ house.’"

"It's terrifying," Denise looks out the window. She blinks a little quickly.

"Yes; I thought it was time. I tipped the lid of the piano, and enjoined Émile to continue talking about his nothingness—to accompany the description of his final fall with piano notes. He said, ‘Marcel, nothing I could accomplish yet would be as grand as my outright death,’ I placed his hands on the keys of the keyboard."

"He wrote this song..." Again, it was not a question.

I took the audio cassette out of my pocket.

"This is Émile Starlight's last work. The song is seven minutes long."

"My God." Denise stared at the tape spinning in my hand.

"Do you want to hear it?"

Denise pulled a Walkman out of her bag without thinking. She placed the tape in the device, then locked herself in between her headphones.

For seven minutes Denise stroked her daughter's cheeks, and she cried, as I cried listening to those words, those minor chords, that last perfection of Émile Starlight. Denise stopped the tape and, with a wet face, the mother kissed her daughter on the forehead.

"I love you, my daughter, I love you forever."

I dozed then, as Denise stared at the night trees, and I saw Denise in reflection looking at Denise, her eyes wet, her hand on her chin, sometimes blowing her nose. Then I fell asleep.

When I woke up, I was alone in the compartment. It was dark. The train was slowing down as it approached my station. I thought Denise and her daughter must have left the train to catch their connection to Liège. I sat up straight. On the shelf in front of me, a paper was waiting for me. I read it:

"Sorry, Marcel. Thanks for everything."

I searched my pockets; the tape of the ultimate Émile Starlight recording was gone.

Part Four

We were taken to a dingy hotel room. It was very casual. In single file, we flew over pine tables, on which the objects were placed. Then we went out and into another room, just as dingy as the other. We could hear through the thin walls the prostitutes moaning the cum out of haggard men, this image was floating on our faces. They paced the corridors, after the junk, before the next, a fag at half-mast on a sticky lip, a fag they pinched with two phalanges in flaking red scissors when they said a word in Romanian to the guys with the long black guns like death guitars slung over their shoulders. We were made to wait with them, when the sales dragged on. We didn't have to take our clothes off, they were doing it on the hoof, well, I could see that for the others, those who were following them, those who had probably dropped the flag when they had seen the prices. 5,000 BTC for the watch of a dead president. 12,000 BTC for a VHS with Cyrillic writing on it. 600 BTC for teeth that "belonged to", with cavities and chips. Hard drives, one of which was priceless, SATA standard, with cable, by the way; it wasn't that old, not as old as all those IDEs you could get here for less than 20,000 BTC. I had seen what I had to see, and I was waiting to make my payment, just hoping that nobody would bid. It was going on in the next room. I was handed a paper ticket, with a QR code, and had to transfer the amount I was bidding on to it with my smartphone. The guys had printed and collected the QR codes, handed out the receipt tickets, and I waited. They offered to pick a girl, I didn't really want to, but out of politeness I ended up sitting on a bed, with a "pretty but not my type" chick, skinny as hell. Even though they were all "guaranteed" I had my doubts about this one. I kept thinking that the guys could just take off with their bundle of QR codes and leave us here in the middle of this godforsaken place. I kept checking the public address on the blockchain to see if the money was still there. It was still there, but it didn't matter, of course. A man with a gun came into the room, he said "One hour", then he looked at the skinny chick, he was questioning me with his eyes, then he said "You want French?", I didn't understand, "come this way", I followed him, we entered another room, where a lady, grey "squared" haircut, legs crossed, was looking out of the window while smoking. "French," the guy said to the lady, and then he went out.

"What the hell are they doing?" the lady said, tapping her cigarette. She stared at me. "Are you French?"

"Yes," I said. She took a drag on her cigarette and then returned to her contemplation through the window of the misty field of the Romanian countryside.

I stood in the corner of the room, silent. She had on some sort of long black leather jacket such as you regularly saw in Nazi films. She looked at me again, tilting her head.

"Grenoble. I saw the object, I made an offer. You?"

"Boulogne. I made an offer too. They told me ’One hour.’"

The lady crushed her cigarette butt with her boot, her arms in eagle's wings, then resumed her pose, legs crossed on her chair. We could still hear the sounds of throats coming from the neighbouring rooms, the bedsprings banging against the walls. Lighting another cigarette, the lady had a funny smile around the filter.

"Nothing for the ladies, of course."

Indeed, the private sale customers were all men, I noticed. Almost all of them. I decided to speak up.

"I couldn’t, anyway."

The lady assessed me and then blew her smoke.

"I could."

She was serious; I unconsciously glanced at the bed, and she followed my gaze.

"There is no rush. What is your name?"

"You know I'm going to give you a fake name," I said.

"That will do. I'll call myself ’Olympus.’"

I stared at her, frozen in place. I dared to raise my hand.

"I am Marcel."

Her smoky smile finally blew.

"I see. _Maxell_, then?"

Maxell was the brand name of the audio tape. She asked me to confirm that we were both there for the same purpose.

"For fuck's sake," I said as I sat down on the bed. I had foolishly hoped I was the only one on it.

The lady looked out of the window again. Cows were grazing in the distance.

"Tell me, _Marcel_," the lady spoke slowly, "where do you place _art_, in a work?"

I lay down on the bed, placed my hands on my chest.

"You're asking me this question so you can answer it," I said. She was still looking at the foggy horizon.

"When I was a young artist, I thought that _art was_ exactly where the artist wanted it to be. I think it was important that I was wrong about that at that time in my life."

"Did you create?" I wanted to know.

"Not enough. But I knew what I was looking for. It can be enough for the artist to know precisely what haunts him, and how to wake up from it sometimes. To touch the point, and the way out. I knew where to dig. Do you create?"

I put my hands behind my head.

"Yes, I have created. And, in a way, the continuation of all that I have undertaken and all that I will undertake again depends entirely on this _object_ that we both want."

"That's what it's all about."

"What our _friend_ accomplished at his piano that day is the apex of your reflection on the place of _art—_but it is also the fuel for mine."

"Do you plan to use this ‘song’ as inspiration to write others?"

"No, Madam. That is not what I intend to do."

"What then?"

"To tell you the truth, Madam, I have heard this song. Only once."

"Impossible," she had bad features, against the light.

"I heard it, because I was the one who pushed _our friend_ to write it."

"I don't believe you," she was staring at me with one eye now.

"I don't care."

Five minutes had passed, we thought. I spoke slowly.

"Who are you?"

"Who are _you_?"

"I told you."

"I don't believe you," she stubbed out her umpteenth cigarette with another twist of her boot.

"I wondered for a moment if you were one of the Worms. I don't remember faces, and then people change. It wasn't so much that I recognised you or not, but you would have recognised me. And since you don't believe me, you are not a Worm."

_Olympe_ stared at me, squinting. She turned back to the window.

"I am blind in one eye and the other one barely allows me to see my way."

"My voice, perhaps?"

"I don't remember Marcel's voice," she said reluctantly, "but just because I don't believe you doesn't mean it's impossible,  now."

"That's good, we're making progress."

She got up, rubbed the folds of her dress, then lay down next to me on the bed.

"I remember Marcel, I have a rather vague image of him, but I remember his gaze on our four little arses. I remember the bitterness in his eyes that he couldn't even put his hand where _he_ put his cock. Those little lots were reserved for _our friend._" Olympe had bent over, and then, when she lay back down again, she was naked. I thought of the Worms, I imagined that _Olympe_ lying hot beside me was Beatrice; Beatrice in 1962. It was quick and violent, our roommates banged on the wall several times. We didn't kiss once, but we had crazy eyes when we got dressed. My orgasm was so brutal that my body asked me this question: fall asleep like a brick, or go back and die. _Olympe_ sat back in her chair, lit a cigarette. I thought, images of what had just happened flashed before my eyes for a few minutes. I spoke first.

"There is progress in this imbroglio, Olympus: during our acrobatics, I did not become you, and you did not become me..."

"Is that so? Let me think otherwise."

"Don't get sentimental, for God's sake. Anyway, if I were now you and you were now me, we wouldn't know any more than each other."

Olympe stared at me pensively. I imagined that she was thinking about the trapdoor.

"What do you want to do with this tape, Marcel?"

"Ah, I_'m_ Marcel, now?"

"You wouldn't have fucked me like that if you weren't really Marcel. So?"

I paused. The room was bathed in cigarette smoke. I answered.

"I want to destroy it."

"You want to _destroy_ the audio tape? Why on earth?"

"Because I heard it."

"Just once!"

"Exactly. And it was perfect. You know what I mean? I want to break the mould of this treasure. Let no one else hear it. I want the exclusivity of that perfection."

"Others have heard it, Marcel. It is obvious."

"I do know the other person who heard it. She is a woman, the woman who stole the tape from me. If there are others than her, only she should know."

"What are you going to do?"

"Go after her, and ask her. _Get_ it _from_ her, if I have to."

Again we were silent. Then the door opened. A man with a gun said "Number 42, the _Maxell_ tape," and then he went out. We looked at each other. Beatrice stared at me, taking a drag on her cigarette.

"Well," she said, "one wins, one loses."

"And we both know it's not going to be that easy."

"Indeed. Anyway, Marcel, thanks for the fuck, if we weren't enemies now, I might have wanted to do it again right now, but I guess we're going to go in two opposite directions, leave Romania and then spend our time trying to stab the other in the back."

"Tell me, were you... Bookworm Beatrice?"

"Maybe... Would you want that I were?"

"I always dreamed of fucking Beatrice, she was the most charming in 62."

"She was the youngest, pervert."

"That will do. Have a nice day, Olympus," I got up.

"Next time, Bookworm Beatrice will fuck you, Marcel."

I closed the door and swore to myself that I would never see her again, except from behind.

Part Five

Gregorovitch was patiently tapping his fingers on the dirty cover of a closed telephone book. He was watching me with a small unconscious smile, a smile lost in my thoughts; perhaps he was assessing what I knew of my good fortune—or my terrible fate; perhaps he felt pity for me, or for himself for that matter, and in that he reminded me of the ticket collector at Boulogne train station, thousands of miles away, who got suddenly sad I thought when he saw my ticket; he had stared at me then just like Gregorovitch did now, probed me likewise for a moment; perhaps they both wanted to convey something to me through their eyes; a warning, or perhaps that I should have known they now ranked me among their enemies... Or were they telling me that _they_ were stuck where they were, never to move, never to travel, that they dreamt of going where I was going, but as I didn't know where that was (the writing on the ticket I had been sent was in Cyrillic), perhaps they too simply wanted to set off into the unknown, thousands of miles away; to get lost; perhaps the information they had passed on me was this: that my unusual destination invoked a qualifier that they would end up uttering, one of those words you've read somewhere but never used, that will come back to you; Gregorovitch, who was standing in front of me in this office located who knows where, was telling me the same complex versions of "warning" or "why not"; and so, yes, why not, he opened the telephone book at long last, turned a sommelier's finger over a menu, scratched out the names, finally pointed to an area of the bible paper, tapped, circled with a felt-tip pen a red oval; and then tore out this page, which he folded into four and slipped into an envelope, which he handed to me.

At the hotel I _discovered_ my bedroom, which is to say that when I arrived in town earlier I had had a glimpse of it, in broad daylight, but of course bedrooms only really show themselves once evening falls. Before me were its torments, its sparse oxygen, the shadow of my body sliding with each of my movements, its raw colours of overdose alleyways. But of course it was the other way round, it was my own torments that I was projecting onto these walls, these sheets, in the twilight of a solitary journey that could well be endless for me. A journey through a night where traumas were reminded by the ribs of bastard wood; terrors that always had the same icy smell, the same bile-yellow fabric, the same cracked ceiling, woven with black silk; and then this small girl in charge of sheets, which passed you by, entered the room, young, fatigued, her forehead gleamed with an olive sweat, she debated her arms and the sheets made a dome, the balls of cotton over the bed on which you were about to lie down disgusts you, something black could have clawed from it, but the tissue falls with a perfume of powdered feet, and you just stare at the skinny and naked ankles of this young girl, with muscles like pulsating Adam’s apples; just stare at her ghost, ghost in the shape of the things we do to the small staff in hotels, of stains, of odours, in the shape of silence, in a breath blocked the stars; young ugly skinny and sick girl, with hair that reminds you of a poor wench you had loved, loved so much your throat squeezes still, a family member, who stammered, who did not ask for anything, who did not complain, who gave you the set of traumas you have, which makes you more human, vulnerable, suicidal. Those hair, that haircut, that yellow fume, those lice, that slow death without a sound in the tumult, that poor girl, whom you had never hugged, who would have taken that gesture for an impulse that took just everyone, because life is like that, made up of blows and red showers, an « Hollywood » hierarchy that recall you back to your investigation, the paper in the envelope, the actress with a name you don't know because you can't read it; all you have is a phonetic name, which, along with your train ticket paid for by E. S., is your entire dossier.

Bringing the actress Macha Salvienko to the West.

The room, I call it a room now out of respect for bedrooms, is now plunged into darkness, I'm alone within its nocturnal walls, an emanation simply comes, after my eyes have become accustomed to it, from the bedside table, and perhaps another, who knows, a faint halo, above the metal desk, two galaxies a few steps apart and yet, if you count the time travelled by light... I groped for a seat on the metal chair facing the desk, emptied my bag under the dim light bulb, the officer's white envelope in sepia and, all around, a black gradation towards fall and oblivion.

The page of the telephone book, unfolded, a shroud of cigarette leaves. At the bottom an oval drawn in red felt-tip pen, and in that oval five or six indecipherable names. Which is the right one? Which is Macha Salvienko's? I write down (rather I draw) all five of them on a separate sheet of paper. At worst I'll annoy four people. The last number I write down in the dark, because the halos, the one on the desk and the one on the bedside table, are no longer obvious to me. Only four midnight blue rectangles come closer and closer, the window frame as a glimmering ghost—Soon it's cold and windy, I'm balancing on a ledge, in this cobalt night, clinging to what could be a television aerial, the horizon a charcoal flag, but a song behind the wind is perceptible, it comes from above, and above, on a slope, there's a lit window from which comes the intimate lullaby. I hear a young girl doing her hair, sitting, her head bent, her movements as slow as her sad melody. I climb the slate, blind except for the scent of smoothed hair. I recognize this perfume, this smell, I give it the colour of the young maid's, the thickness of sebum, and the face of Claire; Claire is the girl the maid reminded me of, I want to see Claire again... Steep tension, finally a vision of a tiny interior, corresponding to the peak of the roof, a pyramid of wood and slate, a candle, I knock on the window, the girl doesn't look at me, but, her hair like a curtain, she opens the window with one hand, then sits back down on her stool, at no time has she taken any information about the person climbing into her bedroom, she continues to sing, just as low and badly, her straight hair separates us when I set foot on the bare floor; I almost fall over, close the window, sit down myself on her bed, so low is the ridge, the candle flame barely outlines our silhouettes, I let myself be lulled to sleep by the ugly song, and finally I fall asleep, or rather, I think of nothing but phantasmagoria, little brain storms that prove I am dreaming, if only I hadn't been since my departure from the Boulogne station two days ago.

In electric plumes I dreamt of an explosions of colours, of strong smells, the feeling of a weight over my body and, at the end of a sharp tension a relaxation. I dreamt that, as one scratches the blood of a mosquito bite, I ejaculated, and then the dream continued, hallucinated, I was feverish and running in the cold outside, my thighs as bare as my feet, stepping on the bumpy, black cobblestones, I ran behind a skinny princess whose hand I was holding, a perfume of sulphur wafting in her wake, a carrot for the donkey I was, and in my sleep I turned over, pulled my blanked back up, looked for the pillow, rolled it up, held this lemon-scented ball of flesh in both hands, and the princess slapped my hands, put her dress back down in place, smoothed it out, and soon we were running blindly over a marshy ground, into which we were eventually sunk up to our waists, infernal water lilies stuck to my suddenly skeletal ribs and then only our heads protruded, and I turned over again in the straw bed, plunged my head, suffocated, fell into a new dream cycle; we were sinking, sliding now like a furrow in the mud, then falling from a ceiling of soft earth into a green cellar. In my sleep, I was dreaming on yet another deeper level.

Under a dome of rock, the green cellar was an emerald lake; from its depth emanated a lagoon-like light, coming from I don't know what memory. For I was exhuming something there, in that calm, luminous lake that looked like a fountain of knowledge. It all came from me; I knew that one sip of this green liquid would gift me wisdom; and this new wisdom would teach me one sip would be enough for a God to have, or that perhaps it wouldn't be enough, but the wisdom would teach me to live with this little.

Next to me, the skinny princess was undressing, and then she was walking on this strip of rock where we were, and sinking into the green water, up to her bare waist. I was lying on the strip of rock, watching her head above water now, she was looking here and there for some floating tree leaves, which she caught in her mouth. Then, at last, she emerged from the green water, came towards me, tried to kiss me with that humus that I spat out as soon as it touched my teeth; but this little was already working and, in my coma, I fell into the depths of a dream within a dream within death within a dream. In this intertwined fantasy, I was back in my room, and the delirium persisted: I observed my hands, like a psychotic in the throes of decompensation, noting that my fingers were as far away as they could possibly be.

The dreamy scent of the creaking door behind me, and a silhouette in the frame; my eyes caught the end of the barrel of a rifle pointed at me. It was a middle-aged woman, unknown to me, but apparently she knew very well who I was; I could smell the sulphur in her stench. The drug made me sniff and stare.

She spat a word at me in a Soviet language and gestured sharply with her gun towards my luggage. I complied; opened my suitcase to reveal a change of clothes and some notebooks—but of course I knew what she was after. Maybe I knew who she was at that moment, maybe I understood the effect of the lake drug on my teeth. I lifted up the double bottom, with one gesture she took the roll of film and was swallowed by the corridor.

This woman's decision to let me live in the madness of destitution led me to the decision that the day I got the film back, I would marry her so totally that she would kill herself.

Part Six

By dint of leading this life, I had ended up in Liège. I knew very little about the place; I had an idea of it as an ancient haven of literary freedom, a history of censorship which, during the centuries when it had been in force in Paris, had not taken place here. When I got off the train, it was winter; around the brown station, the grey-green houses with their white roofs, whose discontinuous mouldings barely bulged out of the icy carpet, soared like the foreheads of the sick.

I had come to Liège to write my novel; to follow in the footsteps of the subversive free thinkers of the French Revolution. I didn't mind appearing ridiculous in my approach, because if I failed, my little ways would be quickly passed over in silence, published under a pseudonym in an obscure collection of _France Loisirs_; whereas if I left the place with the masterpiece I was hoping for, well, perhaps I would create a dynamic that would bear my name, and that of my work. Perhaps this "process" was for me "God's part", that silly Faith which in the real world really does move mountains. For André Gide, this "God's part" was the unexpected meaning that your writing takes on, in the course of which ideas that are beyond you are inadvertently born, but which nevertheless end up in black and white—and say much more than you wanted to say with your small earthly capacities. And perhaps I also wanted to be crossed by these unspoken words; Liège, so close, was nevertheless a far away enough place for God to surprise me there, and for me to surprise God there; for my blood to do laps of astonishment and to activate my unconscious as never in Boulogne.

My hotel was near the Guillemins station, in a rue Sohet a little setback from the passage of cars, or people. You arrived in a hall (around you, people wrapped up in old clothes were drinking coffee in their mittens, which they didn't seem to deserve, if you believed their shifty eyes, as if it had been offered to them, or paid for with money from a robbery), gave your name, a dry old lady (you imagine she is, because you would have become one, you, in rue Sohet; but maybe she's a cream of a woman, after all, maybe she offered all those coffees, maybe she'll smile at you) would slip you a key from which hung a Bakelite casino chip, and then you'd find yourself alone facing a spiral staircase, a suitcase in each hand, convincing yourself that this is indeed happening to you and not to your character in a Parisian historical novel, the one who lives in you and who will have to be typed at length on the Olivetti. And then you would climb the stairwell, head up, counting the floors, until you reached the last one. There's a landing, where a small straight wooden staircase leads to a trapdoor set into the ceiling, which you tip over, poking your head up at the rough, dusty wooden floor, over which your eyes jerk past a floor bed that faces the office promised in the ad.

When Émile puts his two suitcases (one small, one large) on the bed, this man is already no longer myself. He thought for a moment that it was you, reading the report of a memory, but you wouldn't read any further if you were him—you wouldn't want to relive the burning, you wouldn't do that to yourself. So Émile, who is neither me nor you but this third person, the only point of view my character can take without being frightened of what lies ahead, puts the little suitcase on the desk, rattles the metal joints and unlocks the lid of his Olivetti. His other suitcase contains clothes for the time of his stay, and reams of paper. The typewriter now sits on the desk, dominating the head of an Émile who lies on his bed on the floor, fully dressed. He stares at the roof peak, it's still there. After a while it seems to him that his hands are resting on his chest in a dead man's manner. His head spins at the thought and so, through the siphon of imagination, sleep takes him away.

When Émile woke up, people were fighting a few feet away, on the other side of the walls and floors. Two men were shouting at each other in the low tones, a woman was shouting in rage in the high tones, a discussion which, according to the snippets Émile understood, was going in circles. He had decided to go for a walk, or to consume alcohol in good company. In the hall, he had asked where one could drink in the crowd, where one was losing one's mind, and he had been told about the "Carré", the remedy for everything, for boredom, for winter, for the end of the worlds, which one could reach from here by bus 4. He had asked again, leafing through his notes in belgian francs, how much a bus ticket cost. And now at the bus stop Émile is cold, surrounded by the evening snow, blue, or amber, in the halo of the last shops, sodium lamps hanging on the facades, red headlights discontinuous in the jolts of traffic. People surround him, static, sad, dressed in black. Sometimes an orange child gesticulates, an electric blue child piles up snow, gets her mittens tapped. In front of the feverish bus, in its patient white headlights that come to a standstill, a thin snow glitters.

Outside, when the bus doors have folded down, the roofs of knee-high cars follow Émile's gaze for a moment and then move aside, or are left behind, in a low exhaust fart. No one speaks, everyone waits, their faces relaxed in a hypnotic emptiness, their bags on their thighs, their hands on their hips; the bus accelerates in a camshaft madness. Émile observes the names of the streets around this boulevard; he has been told to get out at the third stop. A seated mother leans over her daughter, who stares at me, flapping her arms; I cannot at this moment leave this little happiness to our third person. When Émile gets off, he puts his hands back in his felt, stays for a moment at the stop of bus 4, observing like a panoptic beacon the different passages towards this "Carré"; young people rush into a particular, narrow street, from which some fashionable music comes, some nihilistic excitements of the end of the seventies, and lights, and slumped people, and a triangle tinkles; a drunk man is drinking from two glasses; and a lady in leather is smoking a cigarette and taking big steps in front of everyone to get undressed; a man passes in front of her, she calls out to him, the cigarette hangs from her lips, she says things to him while lifting her breasts. Émile looks at his watch. A juggler further down the street that he is walking down throws three pins as the brass of a trumpet bursts beside him, and two half-naked girls start dancing on the snowy ground. It is in this hubbub, which seems to last for hundreds of metres, branching off at crossroads and continuing in all four directions, that Émile begins to understand this concept of "Carré"; he has seen drunken lovers in each other's arms, perhaps a breast has come out of one, a hand in a pair of trousers, but the sounds of shattered glass break through the deafening music of each crowded café; a third man urinates against a wall; perhaps a second woman too, crouching on a drain; Émile enters this café where in a haze of a thousand cigarettes pulsate multicoloured spotlights; at face level, people carry their beer around his head; the smell of sweat thickens the more Émile sinks into this interminable crowd; he sticks to the bar; he shouts "A beer!" The waiter disappears, Émile looks for his cigarettes; a coaster is placed on the zinc with a beer; Émile gives him a hundred-franc note; the barman gives him back a note of a different colour. Perhaps he needed all this, all this "Carré"; he feels good there, elsewhere; lost. Perhaps God will find him here, at the bottom of a glass. The bodies of women and girls brush against him, push him, marry him; the sweat and the curves of the breasts, the heads that turn over his when it's hard to pass, that warm girl's breath stirs, this one in particular, fruity, much too close; she's pressed against him, she's boiling, she's talking into his mouth, the delirium of the sound system pacing her cherry grazing; what a beauty; the girl repeats herself, and as Émile only sniffs her, the girl takes the cigarette from his fingers and takes a long puff. "Would you like one?" the girl says yes; she has wedged herself next to him at the bar, they are both cornered, so the barman plays with the volume of his sound system to the lyrics of a well-known singer, which the whole café repeats in chorus in the provoked silences; the girl brings her cigarette to the tip of her lips, crosses her eyes when Émile scratches the lighter; "What's your name?" he barks, but the girl gestures to an invisible glass; Émile points to the waiter, and pulls out another note; she cries out over the zinc and the barman slips away again; the girl stares at Émile; the glass has arrived, she leaves it there, takes a drag on her cigarette; Émile is totally charmed; he asks her "Do you want to go somewhere?" The girl says "Yes, after my drink," and she drinks it in one gulp, then, taking Émile by the hand, she guides him through the impossible crowd towards the back of the café; Émile looks across the room at the fading entrance door; they both find themselves in front of a door which she opens and, still pulling Émile by the hand, the girl pushes him into a toilet cubicle; she hikes up her skirt and, authoritatively, shouts "Fucking do it!" Émile marks a moment, pulls down his trousers; she pushes him to sit on the enamel bowl and sits on him. Coitus is brutal in the muffled cabin.

"What is your name?"

"Claire."

"What was that?"

"A shag; what was it like?"

"Are you hungry, Claire?"

"I want to sleep. I am lost."

"I live in a hotel not far from here, Claire; I can take you there..."

"The Ramada?"

"I don't think so; it's near the station..."

"Let's go."

Émile and Claire hold hands on the nocturnal boulevard, populated by an accelerated world; soon the boulevard calms down, traced from time to time by a car studded with snow; the ears ring, the air is fresh, Émile is a little drunk, but he feels light; this girl gives him back his lost impression of being young and stupid; she walks with her short skirt, and her legs are unjustly beautiful, undeserved, invigorating; she has no bag; she has no shoes; her feet are bare on the snow and bloody; Émile does not mention it, so as not to break this moment; they do not speak, they walk alone towards the station hotel at the end of the boulevard, crossing each halo of sodium light, glancing at each other in secret; Claire's eyes are drowsy, but she stares at him sometimes, and she seems to want to take in everything there is to take in his features, and each time her hand closes more firmly in his, as if his face confirmed her decision, confirmed that something important is happening for real; Émile is seized with an erotic impulse every time his eyes are lost in hers, under the halo, and the hand that clasps him tells him every time that something very important is about to happen; without the slightest doubt: their lives.

The ticket office was deserted when we entered the hotel. I took my key from the little sign and we climbed the stairs. Claire strolled ahead of me, I was lost in the salts and brimstone of her skirt, my nose and mouth lost in the folds of that light, soiled curtains; Claire's bare feet were illuminated by little nightlights embedded in the corners of the staircase steps, and I could see the blood between her toes, and two ragged red nails.

When we reached the bottom of my room, opposite the small wooden staircase leading to the trapdoor, Claire didn't move; she stayed at the foot of the first step as I climbed, causing the trapdoor to swing open. I pulled myself up, then watched her through the wooden frame. The viewpoint reminded me of a kind of Polaroid with depth. She had one hand on her collarbones and was staring back at me. I couldn't read anything on her face. She finally decided to come upstairs and, standing between the bed and the desk, we kissed for a long time; it seemed we couldn't stop devouring each other's lips and tongues and throats, and it wasn't even a considered decision that led us to undress standing up, putting our arms to work inhabited by their own life, and passionately enjoying each other for a time that doesn't belong to time, that is vertical and horizontal and askew; to end up, in yet another arching, entangled in the middle of two deep comas

When I woke up, it must have been three in the afternoon. Claire was no longer in your bed. You don't get up right away; you remain prostrate, naked above the covers—you don't know what's overcoming you—a torpor in any case—that she's gone, that she's abandoned you—that you'll never see her again—that she doesn't love you—that she never existed.

It's like those days in the suburbs.

I remember a song I only heard once. An ode to the end of time.

These are days like the ones Marcel Starlight sang about, his end of the world, that famous time in Boulogne.

Émile gets up, he is alone in the room; it is 6 o'clock in the evening. He has been lying prostrate in bed for three hours, imagining Claire coming up through the trapdoor. The silence is total. Émile dresses and then stands in front of the wooden frame on the floor. The silence, mixed with the impression that nothing is moving in the hotel, is deafening. He leans over and swings the door open, and spends a moment observing this black square that tells him nothing of value. He tries a bare foot, which touches an invisible step, lost in the gloom, made of damp wood, which bends and creaks. Émile dives. He is in the dark, a single bright square above his head, which does not light his steps on the worm-eaten staircase. He goes down again. Then he touches a spongy floor, a smell of shit, flies touch his calves; slowly, slowly his eyes adjust to this darkness. The smell is unbearable. It is dark and red at times, Émile feels his way around; he finds himself in a mysterious room in which amber particles float in the air, and these particles, as they swirl, change their tone, as if there were a source of light nearby. An inferno. Now the table in the centre of the room has broken away from the nothingness; but barely; Émile perceives people sitting at this table; four people are sleeping, head first on an open book; even closer... A hand on Claire's shoulder, Claire?, Claire?, and her hand retracts with a swirl of cobwebs. Claire topples over in her chair, and in a joint of loose bones, she collapses in a heap wrapped in bone and bastard cloth, and dirty, at the foot of her chair. Émile has to get out, he has to get out of here, he glances at her back, sees the white square of the trap door, and is it fear or something else that makes him finally see this room for what it really is? Or is it something else that tells him that he is in a library, and that the four women are like bookworms who have decided to lock themselves in forever with thousands of books?—But it's not the fear or anything else: the tongues of fire have begun to lick the walls; the light is turning to gold and bronze; a sliver of fire has landed a few centimetres from the book Claire was reading—Émile, as if in a foolish reflex, has grabbed the volume, to preserve it... or maybe to understand what is happening here—a tongue of fire takes him by surprise, licks his arm, bites his trousers, he has to get out... But the library is burning, the blaze took no more than a minute, as if fuel oil had precipitated the explosion of the shelves; in this infernal crackling, the sound of clattering cloth, Émile limps towards the distant trapdoor, and burns, almost consumes himself on the spot, but by a combination of circumstances that perhaps should not have happened he manages, when he is only half a living torch, to pull himself up onto the worm-eaten staircase, which he tramples one last time before it collapses—he sticks his head out through the trapdoor, in a last effort pulls himself up, then swings the flap with his foot in a great flap.

When we wake up, the silence is gone; morning has risen through the small skylight, and our burns are brittle carbon bites. The neighbours are shouting at each other again, the voices low and the voice high, the cars are honking and the rain is falling with the first bright crack of the sky.

We lie on the floor for a while, tracing the form of 'reality' that was last night.

Claire...

We fumble with the leather cover of a half-roasted book. We'll see it later. We'll see—later.

Did we experience all this? That sudden and total love that grabbed us by the throat like a meat firebrand? And that other meatbrand, which we scraped into our love made of flesh, that brutal entrenchment repeatedly in the greedy, glistening fruit of urgency? Those throats unfurled in unison, a unison that precipitated our tearing contortions? Am I...

Have I gone mad—a medical madness—about Claire?

Your faith in my overall love for this young woman is all that conceives her reality. Your faith, to put it another way, in literature, in its involvement in reality.

I suppose it will be time for me to talk about this book; the one brought back from the underworld. Unlike me, apart from its charred leather cover, it is intact. All its pages are fresh. Its title, recalled inside, spins and spins in my mind; I leave the honour of choosing the words to you; for whatever you think before the sequel, the title you imagine will be, until it is revealed, the only correct title. I endorse it.

And so I remained for a long time, under the ridge of the roof, muttering these questions in silence, hypnotised by the rain which in successive waves riddled the skylight. The four little squares of light had been passing through all this time, distorted, with the speed of the stars, from my desk to my bed. After the storm, this calm day had unfolded, I believe, as days in the suburbs do.

I remember going down to the hotel lobby and drinking a thick soup prepared by a tenant on the first floor, a small Jewish man who, he told me, spent the rest of his time walking the platforms of the Guillemins station with his accordion. Next to me soon a woman from the second floor, small and red-haired, was drinking this soup with warm moans. Her eyes went from my burnt arm to my eyes, crinkling there with a painful smile, as if in sympathy. I realised, as I was being analysed, that I had taken the cooked book with me. I probably hadn't done it on purpose; perhaps it had pinched itself under my roasted paw, and since my burnt arm didn't feel anything anymore, I had come down from my room unconscious of having had my wing charged. The little redheaded woman's name was Chantal, and she had quickly mentioned her interest in the little volume; could she handle it? Soon the book was spinning in her very white little fingers, all the whiter for being quickly covered in soot. And I said nothing. And she was still looking at it, and I still said nothing. I assessed her eyes and her red mouth, the size of the O in her lips, the green slits in her eyelids that swept the lines. A curiosity that turned, as the pages went by, into dismay: "That's German..."

The author was Prussian, indeed; but I did not give her this information, for fear that one thing led to another and she would, by this clue, retrace the whole history of the Magic of Bookworms. She asked me, "Have you read it?" and I told her that I had indeed read it (without admitting to her that the reality was quite different when I read it).

"Can you tell stories, sir?"

"I think I do." I was a bit defensive.

"I'm staying in 203; shall we say 7 o'clock tonight?" She handed me back my book with a smile on her face.

During the afternoon, the rain fell again in flakes. My skylight had slowly become covered, and I stared at that strange speckled window like a television screen tuned to a channel that was no longer broadcasting. And then in my thoughts, as I anticipated the story I was going to tell the little redheaded woman in room 203, an image on that screen would form, and I would tilt my head, hypnotized by the story I was repeating. And then, having emerged from this state at about 7 o'clock in the evening, my small room on the third floor had turned into the larger one in room 203, a transition devoid of transitions; Chantal, with her bare feet tucked under her thighs, and I were drinking tea, which my lips left to continue the story.

"Markus von Salviertt was a talentless writer," I said to her, as I had said to myself, "and when his friend, whose name has not gone down in history (but let's Germanise mine, to simplify things), once made it clear to him that his books would not fit into any long-standing literature, Markus told him that it didn't matter; for wasn't it true that in that Salzburg inn where he liked to write his fiction, young women would come and smile at the back of his neck? Yes, indeed," Emil had said, "but there's no _talent_ there_,_ is there?" Markus had shrugged and pointed to his sheets, sticky with thigh juice. But, said Emil, this is just entertainment, isn't it? What about a wedding? The serious stuff that none of your tumbling entails? Markus had smiled, adorned himself with his only quill and parchment, and looked inspired, alternating his gaze to the horizon with the tip of his quill scraping the thin bark. So? Don't you think, Emil, that the alternation of these gestures would be worth my while? Your _pose_, Markus? Only this one, the writer had argued. But who would fall for the bluster? Markus had looked Emil in the eye: simply the four most beautiful women in Salzburg! All four of them will put their pretty arses on the chair you occupy, Emil—and I will marry all four of them!"

Chantal would get up at the end of my chapter, to fill the teapot, and for the second time she would play a cassette on a hi-fi system which, I realised without really paying attention, was not playing any music. I had been talking for two hours when…

"Are you... Record my story?"

"Shouldn't I?"

It wasn't that simple; confusion overcame me; I remembered the _Maxell_ tape that had been stolen from me on that train to Liège, and I thought of Olympe, and as my eyebrows furrowed in thought, Chantal had straddled me. To our left, in the cassette recorder, the tape was still running, and would capture our gasps as a B-side was wound up and slammed down at the end of the 45-minute tape.

That December passed, I think, as December passes in the suburbs. I wrote down my version of the facts, my version of my lies and, on the train back to Boulogne, I wondered if my _pose_, like that of our dear friend, had not opened up Claire's thighs, my forever love; and those, more anecdotally, of this Chantal—supernumerary coitus, but how revealing, which proved to me that Markus's 'way' was perhaps rubbing off on my little person.

And now, on this train, I'm thinking about the novel I typed during those Liège nights: the story of a _Maxell_ tape to be destroyed, intertwined with the beginnings of my new mission, which sees me reunited with my dear Claire, before a fitting end.

See you in volume 2 of "A Magic of Bookworms", soon available, for the continuation of this dark story.
